These\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\nand (vi) Explainability.

      "generation": "The success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation tasks\nheavily depends on a large amount of labeled data to supervise the training. On\nthe other hand, the annotation of biomedical images requires domain knowledge\nand can be laborious. Recently, contrastive learning has demonstrated great\npotential in learning latent representation of images even without any label.\nExisting works have explored its application to biomedical image segmentation\nwhere only a small portion of data is labeled, through a pre-training phase\nbased on self-supervised contrastive learning without using any labels followed\nby a supervised fine-tuning phase on the labeled portion of data only. In this\npaper, we establish that by including the limited label in formation in the\npre-training phase, it is possible to boost the performance of contrastive\nlearning. We propose a supervised local contrastive loss that leverages limited\npixel-wise annotation to force pixels with the same label to gather around in\nthe embedding space. Such loss needs pixel-wise computation which can be\nexpensive for large images, and we further propose two strategies, downsampling\nand block division, to address the issue.

Interactive segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves allowing a user to interact with an image to indicate the regions of interest.

Our approach uses a novel edge-guided flow algorithm that propagates user input along the edges of an image, allowing for fast and accurate segmentation of complex images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeFlow through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art interactive segmentation methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.\n\nIn addition, we explore the versatility of EdgeFlow by applying it to a variety of applications, including object segmentation, medical image segmentation, and video segmentation. Our results show that EdgeFlow can handle a wide range of scenarios, from simple object segmentation to complex medical image segmentation, and can accurately segment objects in real-time.\n\nOverall, EdgeFlow represents a significant advancement in the field of interactive segmentation, providing a practical and efficient approach that can be used in a variety of applications. Its ability to accurately segment images with minimal user input makes it an ideal tool for a wide range of users, from researchers to practitioners."

However, the widespread adoption of AI in medical imaging is contingent on the development of trustworthy AI systems. In this paper, we present the consensus recommendations of the Future of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (FUTURE-AI) working group, a multidisciplinary group of experts in medical imaging, AI, and ethics. The FUTURE-AI working group was convened by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to develop a set of guiding principles and consensus recommendations for trustworthy AI in medical imaging. The FUTURE-AI working group identified four guiding principles for trustworthy AI in medical imaging: (1) transparency, (2) explainability, (3) fairness, and (4) accountability. The FUTURE-AI working group also identified a set of consensus recommendations for trustworthy AI in medical imaging, including recommendations for the development, validation, and implementation of AI systems. The FUTURE-AI working group's recommendations are intended to guide the development of trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging and to promote the safe and effective use of AI in clinical practice.\n\n\\textbf{Keywords}\n\nArtificial intelligence, medical imaging, radiology, ethics, transparency, explainability, fairness, accountability\n\n\\textbf{MSC}\n\n68T05, 68T10, 68T15, 68T20, 68T30, 68T40, 68T50, 68T60, 68T70, 68T80, 68T90, 68T99, 68W05, 68W10, 68W20, 68W30, 68W40, 68W50, 68W60, 68W70, 68W80, 68W90, 68W99, 68Z05, 68Z10, 68Z20, 68Z30, 68Z40, 68Z50, 68Z60, 68Z"

      "generation": "[Abstract] At present, future medical imaging is increasingly being used to diagnose patients with cancer or other life-threatening problems without a physician's input (1\u21d3\u21d3\u20134). In fact, this level of patient monitoring has emerged as an urgent need and a cost effective alternative to a conventional surgical strategy of operationally treating disease when clinical findings warrant it (5, 6). However, current techniques are relatively costly compared to human surgeons who still perform a significant portion of total imaging-related revenue (7). Consequently, healthcare systems must now prioritize not just what images should be captured but how they ought to be collected and organized (8). To date, many experts have agreed that large volumes do require to be recorded (9) for certain types of health issues such as cardiac infarction detection in which information is relevant beyond simply allowing doctors to detect atrial fibrillation [6]. These guidelines also dictate use of standardized storage methods for storing medically useful clinical information on large-scale data centers (10), although others would like to see greater transparency about which institutions hold the most medical data, thereby enabling citizens to decide whether privacy is important when making healthcare decisions using mass data (11). Despite these differences, no consensus approach exists regarding the best way forward with respect to both capturing mass imaging images and maintaining appropriate access, quality and security while recording them on centralized data sources. This raises the question: Should we seek solutions which maximize efficiency while minimizing the amount stored or rely only on technologies for storing information?\n\nWe propose the following guiding principles for designing trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical imaging and apply them to several challenges currently facing contemporary diagnostic machine learning that include: identifying common diseases in high volume samples; detecting noncontroversial features in large quantities at low accuracy through pattern recognition or image classification based on prior knowledge, like heart rate, pupil size; locating and cataloguing images to obtain relevant contextual context that may contribute to treatment recommendations and identify potential anomalies; performing post-processing routines such as pre and/or post activation (activation steps) and noise correction, as well as creating customized visualization programs by automatically modifying predefined templates in order to better understand what is represented in these files; and providing continuous feedback as to how the algorithms are interpreting the medical data and helping healthcare physicians make decisions regarding management"

      "generation": "Artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly machine learning, has become increasingly prevalent within healthcare as diagnostic support technology known as artificial intelligence medical systems, with applications spanning multiple areas including radiology and pathology imaging data interpretation but also genomics to facilitate precision medicine efforts. In response to this rapid innovation dynamic, we seek to help ensure that AI within all contexts of health care are trustworthy through the lens of human-machine collaboration. Toward these ends, experts representing a diversity of disciplines engaged across government agencies, academic institutions, industry leaders, and patient advocacy group representatives gathered at an international workshop entitled FUTURE-AI. A major goal was to elucidate how best practices could be developed toward achieving trustworthiness of AI systems utilized throughout radiological clinical practice workflows from pre-training inputs through validation methodologies to final deployment and ongoing use assessment frameworks. More specifically, during sessions over five days participants identified key principles pertinent to designing machine intelligence technologies in conjunction with humans on which future guidance documents can be built. Topics included definitions of terms such as explainability, fairness and bias, transparency and accessibility; ethical considerations around human factors involved in the design of intelligent machines especially when applied clinically; and approaches to training, testing, validating and deploying models in realistic clinical environments for diverse patient populations. Participants also assessed gaps in existing AI standards and made suggestions regarding necessary improvements or updates currently lacking in order to promote future safe system development and implementation, ultimately leading to recommendations for moving forward along established guidelines. Through this consensus process, we hope to inform best practices for using advanced computer science analytics towards helping physicians deliver optimal patient outcomes."

Our model is trained on a large dataset of images with segmentation masks, and is able to predict a flow field that can be used to segment new images. The flow field is guided by the edges in the image, which allows the model to capture the structure of the image and produce accurate segmentations. Our model is trained using a novel loss function that is based on the edge-guided flow model. The loss function is designed to encourage the model to produce a flow field that is consistent with the edges in the image. We evaluate our model on a number of benchmark datasets, and show that it is able to produce accurate segmentations. We also show that our model is able to produce segmentations that are more accurate than those produced by other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe paper is available here."
