In response to this rapid innovation dynamic, we seek to help ensure that AI within all contexts of health care are trustworthy through the lens of human-machine collaboration. Toward these ends, experts representing a diversity of disciplines engaged across government agencies, academic institutions, industry leaders, and patient advocacy group representatives gathered at an international workshop entitled FUTURE-AI. A major goal was to elucidate how best practices could be developed toward achieving trustworthiness of AI systems utilized throughout radiological clinical practice workflows from pre-training inputs through validation methodologies to final deployment and ongoing use assessment frameworks. More specifically, during sessions over five days participants identified key principles pertinent to designing machine intelligence technologies in conjunction with humans on which future guidance documents can be built. Topics included definitions of terms such as explainability, fairness and bias, transparency and accessibility; ethical considerations around human factors involved in the design of intelligent machines especially when applied clinically; and approaches to training, testing, validating and deploying models in realistic clinical environments for diverse patient populations. Participants also assessed gaps in existing AI standards and made suggestions regarding necessary improvements or updates currently lacking in order to promote future safe system development and implementation, ultimately leading to recommendations for moving forward along established guidelines. Through this consensus process, we hope to inform best practices for using advanced computer science analytics towards helping physicians deliver optimal patient outcomes."

      "generation": "Abstract: Deep learning has made major progress on several segmentation tasks such as semantic and instance segmentation. However, many important practical applications are not covered by existing methods, especially when it comes to interactive segmentation settings including weakly or poorly supervised, unsegmented scenes (Figure 1). While state-of-the-art interative segmentation techniques often do well in these scenarios for simple objects like cars and chairs, they struggle with high resolution datasets that involve complex geometry and large occlusion. Moreover, we find significant performance degradation even under fully supervi- sion which limits their use even with highly structured object labels. In this work, we address these challenges through an intuitive approach guided by boundaries between objects. We propose 'EdgeFlow,' a boundary-aware flow optimization algorithm that uses edge guidance features learned on synthetic data paired with deep network inputs (e.g., RGB) captured from either raw video capture or depth sensors such as Kinect (see Figure 3). Our approach requires neither strong nor dense object labeling for training; instead we only require low supervision of edges through depth input that encodes partial ordering information. On four popular benchmarks, EdgeFlow generalizes better than existing weak-supervision based approaches while achieving comparable accuracy with fully supervised baselines at one tenth of the computational cost. At interactive speed using off-the-shelf hardware components our method outperforms previous works across all datasets for both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations."

Semi-supervised learning provides promising performance with cheap unlabeled data as supplements to limited amount labeled samples in practice. However, due to label bias and domain gap between labeled and unlabeled domains, current semi-supervised methods have not achieved satisfactory results yet. To this end, we propose a novel Transformer-based network named SCTR (Shortcut Contrastive Transformation), which consists of self and super contrastive branches exploiting unlabelled and labelled data respectively. This design can learn richer representations with both supervised and non-supervised training signals through two parallel shortcuts by alleviating label shift problems existing between supervised and pseudo-supervised losses thus improving segmentation performance on challenging datasets like BRAINVISA and BraTS.

However, one typical challenge that exists with Medical MRI imagery is the high imbalance rate, i.e., many organs are present or absent while some other organ sizes vary greatly across examples leading to severe input/output class imbalance during training. This also means that multi-organ segmentation models must learn to deal with both these types of imbalances simultaneously. In this work we propose several regularization approaches towards addressing such bi-imbalanced data using weak labels from multi-class outputs along with unlabeled inputs. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework helps generalize better on test examples compared to both fully supervised methods where soft or hard positive & negative mini-batch balancing techniques are employed.

The model takes two unseen training steps that reduce its number of parameters and enable it to use only one or two labeled slices within the testing volume. These steps are performed with limited labels provided by human experts: They consist first on applying a traditional supervised learning process guided with manually delineated traces at all time levels in the cross section of each labeled slice; then after performing initial parameter reduction and weight pruning via L_p regularization, we conduct unsupervised fine tuning iterations during which neural network weights change according to feature patterns extracted from unlabeled slices in order to minimize divergence between outputs predicted at different neighboring timeslice locations along the 3D axis. As long as noisy features extracted from unmarked volumes help reduce overfitting risks compared to clean label sequences from professional geoscientists, we can finally produce final smooth segments without providing any additional data other than original labeled slices which is also crucial when dealing with sparse datasets. Performance tests show that this strategy succeeds in obtaining faithful interpretable results in synthetic test cases regardless of whether they deal with simple or complex tracings. For real traces obtained from existing exploration well datasets, our method successfully reproduces most of them while generalizing on missing faults.\n\nAside of a very technical description about what I'm not even sure will be feasible, this idea reminds me somehow of how Google has figured out ways to improve machine translation despite having access to comparatively little sample texts. If such methods have worked there before, shouldn't they actually work for something pretty basic like identifying simple geometric structures?

      "generation": "The segmentation task, where a model outputs semantics-aware masks given an image input, has had tremendous success in recent years with new breakthroughs appearing every few months. For instance, fully labeled images are still extremely expensive to label manually and therefore very difficult to amass at sufficient depth required by deep learning models. Additionally, while fine labels such as per object masks allow models to extract the right objects themselves, there exist various levels of labeling that can be provided: e.g., a coarse label can provide mask labels only at the scene level (either global or foreground) without specific information about where certain objects can appear. We propose Lifting, a framework capable of mining any level of available labeling - fine or crude - to lift contextual knowledge within visual representations when performing semantic segmentation on unlabeled data. In our experiments, we use simple heuristic assumptions to effectively mine labeling of varying fidelity. The contributions that this work make include: \u2022 A novel technique (LIFTING), which leverages low quality supervision signals to generate meaningful high quality features used for semantic prediction. This demonstrates that even partial ground truth can help increase overall accuracy across all layers of a vision network; \u2022 Experimental results showing how LIFT combines the advantages of both weakly and strongly correlated datasets through transferability between datasets generated using different techniques. All training procedures run efficiently under parallel computing power and thus are practical.\n\nfrom https://thenewstack.io/image"

However, there has been little exploration on REC under diverse interaction modalities; how people interact with machines varies greatly based on their goals, contexts, environments/conditions they are faced with and available resources at hand. In this work, we introduce Comprehensive REC (CoRE), an image segmentation benchmark comprising 20 subsets that capture multi-modal user interactions via the webcam or microphone, text input only, or various combinations among these. To ensure a comprehensive measure across human-machine referral interaction paradigm, our CoRE incorporates all existing large-scale datasets into a unified framework including TACoS-Interactive, RefCOCO+WebCam & Flickr30k Entities. It is expected to facilitate better understanding by bridging gaps within current research, as well as motivate more fine-grained studies when analyzing REC performance based on different conditions, tasks, and dataset sizes. Moreover, leveraging the wide variety of interactive styles offered in CoRE , we provide baselines built upon Transformer models and show potential generalization ability towards diverse settings. We hope this will encourage further studies on modeling real world scenarios or developing systems capable of such flexibility in human computer interactions (HCIs)."

Given that standard CNNs achieve better performance for classification over segmentation tasks; one natural attempt to adapt them would be through the combination of a 2D convolutional neck with an additional head producing pixel predictions -- a direct yet naive approach called `Vanilla'. To tackle such issues, we propose two novel approaches that boost the base-line models performance by learning complementary representations suitable for dense prediction under low shot scenarios . A feature matching attention module is introduced in order to explicitly enforce consistency between high level visual features extracted by backbone modules for segmentation and downstream task heads. In addition, we also show how adopting global contrastive loss not only improves generalization power but can lead towards discovering more discriminative latent projections. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, yielding superior performances compared against other recent works while being much lighter which leads to faster convergence as well during optimizations."

Our goal is to provide an easy to use framework that can be reused whenever such manual corrections are required in specific domains like cancer detection in digital pathology breast lesions, coronary calcium score prediction, etc., leading to saving time during clinical evaluation which in turn results increased efficiency when compared to existing alternatives like manual ground truth development tools such as ITK-SNAP (Insight Toolkit). This will not only bring down additional cost but also allow radiologists with minimal experience in coding to get involved for the same. Such a generic tool would enable users, who normally do not have access to state of art image processing algorithms/software, to perform accurate image analysis without expert training thus reducing costs significantly. This research specifically focuses on two related tasks: Firstly, we describe how anatomically defined interactive seed regions provided by radiologist input at patient level may help in improving automatic lung nodule detection by avoiding miss detection at early stages through guided analysis; secondly, another example application showcasing feasibility of our methodology pertains to segmentation error correction while generating reference standard images of microscopic breast tissues from WSI."

      "generation": "> Background/Context A network trained via knowledge distillation learns more discriminatively about class-level information with respect to the teacher network and therefore performs better than single soft or hard label training in terms of accuracy measures (e.g., AP, mAP). However, it was found that semantics have not been properly captured by attention maps generated from distilled intermediate layers due to strong gradient influence compared to conventional image segmentation losses. In this work we aim to address these problems specifically within Dense Conditional Random Field Loss based pixelwise loss and propose double similarity constraints imposed on intermediate outputs during distillation as an alternative and effective solution for both class discrimination and semantically correct representation in an end-toend trainable framework which are consistent with the original purpose of knowledge distillation without changing the core of conventional training pipeline except adding two new losses at intermediate features level derived from student output supervision signal.\n>\n> Originality/Value We propose \u201cdouble similarity distillery\u201d where there\u2019re separate knowledge distillation paths applied along channels while remaining identical across positions where similar values encourage local similarities, whereas dissimilarities make sure global context awareness within each predicted channel is taken into consideration through proposed KullbackLeibler Softmax and Mutual Information Constraints in addition to standard Cross-Entropy and Classwise Focal Losses resulting superior performance over stateoftheart methods. Furthermore our empirical evaluation of different types of intermediate target representations confirms that using only single intermediate supervision signal may restrict a model in generalizing its ability for further abstraction of high level details. On PASCAL VOC dataset as well as cityscapes, our proposed method achieved significant gains (+1.1% improvement) compared to recently published stateof- art semantic object detection and image segmentation approach.

Deep Convolutional Neural networks have shown great promises in many applications with its feature extraction capability; yet these models are highly vulnerable to semantic field bias or subject specific noise during training stage especially since deep learning techniques require a large number of images/samples for good generalization. We therefore introduced an unpaired domain adaptation mechanism that aims at mitigating the cross subject difference while making the best use of the self labelled data instead of requiring expensive manual labels. It is not only applicable to multiple scenarios, but also can be used in the same scenario where some segments might need further refinement (either for better performance on the segmentation network itself, or by providing supervision when another network performs on top of this segmentation net)\n\nKeywords: 16527589; Image Processing / Machine Learning - Neuroscience - Classical Medicine"

One of the most challenging tasks in this area involves the segmentation of organs and soft tissue structures with a high degree of precision to extract clinically relevant features that inform or assist physicians interpret disease conditions such as prognosis, progression, metastasis etc. We focus on multi organ/tissue structure segmentations using 2D (CT / X-Ray), cross sectional or other types of image data sets where existing semantic segmentation models based mostly on convolutional neural networks struggle due to limitations including inability to address small anatomical variations specific to each modality and training set, failure to recognize new structural boundaries beyond those encountered during model training, variability in patient appearance and associated difficulties inherent in obtaining sufficiently large labeled datasets particularly when it comes to rare diseases requiring specialized treatment protocols. Therefore, we propose using graphical model based techniques, augmented by DL methods that are able to process unlabeled big-data volumes at much higher speeds compared to supervised learning methods without compromising accuracy rates especially for complex and overlapping classes which characterize medical images. Our findings indicate performance parity between traditional handcrafted algorithms and our proposed methodology yielding comparable results with regards to dice scores between 0.953-1."

      "generation": "> Accurate characterization of cardiac function enables diagnostic evaluation and long term monitoring of patients, especially ones in heart failure or those susceptible to such. However despite its importance, left atrial analysis remains challenging due to low contrast and large variability in shape across subjects. Existing methods use an expensive MRI modality while many clinical applications can benefit from CT which has comparable image quality while being more widely accessible and economical. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised framework that performs both initialization of unseen data and propagates accurate segmentations without manual delineation, which makes it applicable as a scalable tool to mine existing volumetric dataset that are readily available on multiple institutions (e.g., CCTA on NCAT). We propose supervision via pairwise mutual consistency between corresponding slices within a region in left atria, so the model could be applied on large amounts of unlabeled data where only few samples have full annotation ground truth; we further incorporate multimodal information to improve overall performance through feature fusion and shared latents space across modalities. Our experimental results showcase robustness toward noise and variabilities in cardiac morphology compared against strong baseline segmentation models trained with supervised regression. Comparison of our method with alternative approaches demonstrate high segmentation accuracy on three public datasets, in terms of mean Dice score(DM/DT) of 95.68% for LA segmentation using CT and DT=0.24mm when predicting LAA roof using the same scans and 71.3% of Mean DM between LA annotated by two independent human experts. Besides visualization of left atria and their sub-components along with its quantification, this work further introduces several important findings concerning how ventricles and aorta shapes affect prediction confidence over timepoints during training process and provide some insights into interpretation about what is learned inside deep neural networks."

Among them, visual tracking that can robustly detect target objects across multiple frames has attracted tremendous attention [1 \u2013 3]. Since most trackers rely on manually designed features or handcrafted models with limited representational capacity, many efforts have been made to design end-to-end neural architecture search methods, such as SANet[4] in order to obtain effective and differentiable feature modules automatically via reinforcement learning approach and achieve significant improvements over its counterparts. Despite progress with existing methods, these approaches still lack diversity of solutions since they only consider cell selection instead of other building blocks. For example, the channel number remains fixed at 256 throughout all layers in SANet due to the limitation of computation cost during RL training. Moreover, current search space fails to contain convolution kernel size variation without losing generality because each layer is searched independently rather than treated as a whole.\n> In this work we propose an autonomous design pipeline called CHASE that searches optimal network structures along three dimensions including channel number, group ratio, kernel size for both spatial cells and channels at module level. Experiments show our proposed design is more compatible with backpropagation based optimization process compared to conventional ones. Compared to state-of-the-art solution of 98% accuracy, we successfully achieve above performance by adopting less computing resources using VGG-M model. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n> \u2022 We enable the search methodology to handle kernel size variations under certain constraints;\n> \u2022 An efficient backpropagation method is introduced for differentiating modules\u2019 output which requires no prior knowledge about the corresponding gradient;\n> \u2022 A unified differentiable framework is provided for efficiently converging through extensive experiments."

Compared with the traditional encoder-decoder style segmentation networks, our BANet inherits transform block as the key component and significantly speeds up through a seriesof small modifications. Experiments on 37+ categories public dataset Cityscapes show that in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU), BANet achieves very encouraging performances and outperforms all other published methods by achieving state- of-theart result with FPS (frame per second): 120. For instance, with only mFPS =40, our method can achieve almost equivalent performance to existing SOTA models while with much better robust. It indicates that the proposed model is able to generate more accurate prediction results even at lower frame rate or less computational time, laying a firmer foundation for real-time semantic segmenta tion applications [such as visual odometry]. Furthermore, under the setting of limited hardware device for processing, our experiment also proves that BANet has great advantages under both training phase and test stage due\nto its compact structure and simple algorithm. That means it can obtain highly competitive accuracy when running without GPU support using a low end phone like Nokia 6. Therefore, we think BANet could be integrated into more scenarios such as self driving cars where real-time processing is critical."

In this work we describe techniques for performing parallel and scalable image analysis using distributed iterative region growing methods running over a range of different computational models including shared memory threads, message passing interface (MPI), Mapred and Spark based clusters on both small laptops as well as huge supercomputers. We show two key points; firstly how to adapt clustering methods so they can be implemented efficiently across a wide variety of hardware ranging from single processor machines up to petascale clusters. Secondly, rather than just providing benchmarks about these systems we focus our efforts towards developing an end user toolkit around large image segmentations so people interested in performing such analyses are no longer required to know how or what type of system would best fit their requirements. Our current software allows us to test various segmentation tools such as Otsu, Mean Cut, Hue Saturation Value, Chocolate Box algorithm or watershed transformer to name some few which all run very easily through our library. We tested extensively different configuration strategies like SIMD, MPI+OpenMp, hybrid MPI/shared memory programs among others against a number of real life applications which include 100\u2019s Millions of pixels per second. As future goals our toolbox will provide not only implementations but also the corresponding performance results on top cluster architectures along with the availability of several segmented databases generated over time which might serve other researchers to further examine new analysis approaches on high dimensional datasets coming from either astronomy or biomedicine fields of study."

In this work, we propose Trilateral attention network (TAN) which consists of two components: trilaterally adaptive kernel generation and lightweight segmentor, leading to better tradeoff between accuracy and speed comparing with existing methods. To accelerate the speed without much losing precision, TKG exploits local information with sparse structure to generate highly concentrated filter kernels according to the input feature map through three learnable matrices instead of direct 2D/3D dense kernel convolving. Further employing TGS, where the parameters sharing strategy is carried out and multi layer perceptron module and U-net structure are integrated into one single component, achieving comparable performance than previous works as well as greatly reduced amount of FLOPs and total number of trainable weights. Besides, there exists another novelty that, though 1st and 2nd components can be used jointly or independently in our design for different usability, some minor adjustments would be conducted if both parts operate together rather than independently to promote task collaboration with an end-to-end manner. Our method achieves mIoU score ~66% at FPS~4 on ACDC Challenge dataset and ~90% FPS on DRIVE database. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of proposed TAN both quantitatively and qualitatively with much lower FLOPs and more trainable parameters compared to other segmentors, meeting most practical demands."

This is particularly important in laparoscopic surgery, where the surgeon operates through small incisions and relies on a camera inserted through one of the incisions to view the surgical field. The camera provides a two-dimensional (2D) view of the surgical field, which can be difficult to interpret and can lead to errors in surgical planning and execution.\n>\n> To address this challenge, researchers have developed a variety of techniques for enhancing the visualization of the surgical field in MIS. One such technique is stereoscopic imaging, which uses two cameras to capture a 3D view of the surgical field. This allows the surgeon to see depth and perspective, which can be particularly useful in laparoscopic surgery.\n>\n> However, stereoscopic imaging also presents challenges, including the need for accurate and real-time depth estimation.

Our proposed approach requires a relatively large amount of processing time at each frame due to its graph cut implementation in MATLAB(r) environment which needs about 10 seconds per frames in case of medical images (596 x 432) taken during liver tumor resection with robotic arms. However, we believe that this could be applied not only in medical field such laparoscopic surgery, telemedicine etc; but also in humanoid robotics as well as many other intelligent systems where rapid depth perception capability would provide various benefits through active camera control and robust dynamic interaction with people.

      "generation": "> The goal of connectomics is to map the complete neural circuitry of the brain. This requires the segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images into individual neurons. The segmentation of EM images is a challenging task due to the high variability of neuron shapes and the low contrast of the images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the segmentation of EM images. Our approach is based on the idea of reinforcement learning (RL), which allows us to learn from the mistakes of the segmentation algorithm. We use a deep neural network to segment the EM images and a reinforcement learning algorithm to correct the segmentation errors. We evaluate our approach on the Neurodata Challenge 2018 dataset and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms.\n\nThe paper is available here."

In this work, we introduce Reinforce Proofreader (RLcor): an interactive proofreader that enables crowdworkers to review image segmentations by learning reinforcements with only few human corrections on a well-known connectome. By design, our algorithm learns what partitions are difficult to recover accurately while iteratively reinforcing workers' correction at the corresponding locations. We show how RLcor\u2019s self-learning mechanism can effectively alleviate tedious labor input during ground truth validation through two major phases: 1) refining unground-truth labels based on its own prediction; and 2) identifying uncertain pixels requiring expert attention so as to accelerate path tracer's processing over complicated structures via an active masking strategy; thus enabling significantly better performance than previous approaches. As an illustrating application, we apply three state-of-the-art methods on D. melanogaster brain datasets including Path Tracker, DeepPath and Interactive deepPath."

      "generation": "In recent years, deep neural networks have made unprecedented progress in computer vision and other areas with an abundance of labeled data. However, creating rich training labels remains costly or impossible on many interesting tasks due to complexity and subjectivity. An increasingly popular solution to this issue is to train network models by minimizing some distance metric between weak labeled observations (e.g., points) and segmented images as determined by human annotators instead of creating exact boundaries themselves [1]. This relaxation naturally allows for incorporating additional information, such as contextual relationships that help constrain image interpretation. In contrast, typical approaches using point ground truth often ignore the spatial relationship between supervised structures, which can lead to poor generalization. Thus, we propose Points2polygons, an adversarially trained ConvNet capable of jointly utilizing multiple complementary sources of labeling (i.e., both weak labels and dense polygon outlines obtained through manual boundary editing) simultaneously during adversarial training without any need to retrain our model when faced with new weak labels only for all applications. Points2polygons improves over state-of-the-art methods for semantic and instance segmentation from coarse (weak) and complete dense polygon labels by 5%-6%, consistently across various application domains. While our focus is primarily on improving performance using existing datasets containing dense annotations as unlabeled auxiliary ground truth, including our new ones specifically created for validation, our findings should also have important theoretical implications within the ongoing debate regarding the role of strong or weak labels in Deep Learning as well."

We improve these exponential-time techniques by extending them to exact semidefinite programming over grid graphs with larger constant factors. For k-coloring, we give an algorithm running in O\\left({n^5}\\right)\\exp{\\left({\\mathrm{poly}(k)}\\right)}+\\exp{\\left(O\\left(\\sqrt{\\log n}/n^{3/8} \\right) \\right)}$ where n\\in N is the number of nodes in our model with edge density bounded away from one. This improvement extends the approach of Chlamtac et al.\\cite{chitnis2013}. Previously, such improvements have been proven only for graph classes with stronger structural properties or were given only heuristic implementations without specific guarantees on their approximation ratio. We further study how the results extend to other combinatorial max cut settings as well as extensions involving quadratic modular constraints and unweighted constraints arising out of multicommodity flow network cuts which are closely related to knapsack inequalities. We also discuss practical implementation details of this algorithm for graph coloring problems including optimizations through the use of block encoding and the efficient computation of semi-definiteness conditions using randomized techniques like ROT. Combined together with various reduction rules, our practical implementation runs in under the same runtime, often producing high quality solutions when the problem does not have unique optimal solution and can therefore be extended even beyond exact solving."

The control of deformations is determined locally, in contrast with previous local approaches which use edge data only or require globally controllable flows such as velocity fields derived from optical flow methods. Our distance vector flow field adapts itself based on the input edge signal within various neighborhood-sized windows centered at each point along the original active contour. To overcome the problem that smaller windows tend to lead to noisy gradients when applied directly to a binary image (which often forms our input edge cue), we add an extra step after thresholding whereby small connected components are joined together to form continuous edges that can adequately represent fine detail while retaining essential shape characteristics...\n>\n> [...] Finally we apply smoothing over these new edges using the standard gradient descent strategy to obtain more continuous boundaries. This helps us eliminate tiny blobs that result from the merge procedure while preserving important details around sharp corners. At this stage some fine tuning parameters need to be chosen depending upon how fuzzy the input gray scale images are likely to get on one hand and the size and orientation of the objects which appear in the backgrounds of interest. One needs less stringent constraints placed on merging to keep track finer object details near object--background borders compared to tracking edges inside the foreground structure."

Thus two parts could interactively help each other to improve comprehension during training, allowing us better to recognize the target object while having more precise segmentation mask as well as better reference term expression. Besides we propose progressive training process where only a single pair would remain active at the beginning.

This task also provides a more rigorous way to evaluate how good a model can generalize, as there exist many variations of faces such as pose and occlusion. To support this large scale competition, we are building up what we call Open Data Collection (ODC). ODC has over 120,836 training samples collected on-device in a short period. Additionally, it contains approximately 41k validated labels. On top of this data collection effort, we curate several challenging datasets for testing the proposed models. Aside from label noise issues due to crowd sourcing tasks, the results have shown promising performance on state-of-the-art methods across all our test sets under various evaluation metrics, including average intersection over union (aIoU) and average precision (AP). All of the code and data is publicly accessible to ease further researches."

Amongst them are image registration algorithms based on point set matching and parametric deformable model fitting (PDE). An alternative method for automatic landmark localisation directly upon data requires first solving a probabilistic graphical modelling problem using Bayes\u2019 Theorem. It is called Landmarks Location through Local Geometry (L^{3}) but we further extend the work here with two contributions: Firstly, we introduce a new type of statistical model for shapes, which has been shown in previous studies to be suitable within Bayesian contexts involving such geometric features with noise. This is derived as generalised Riemannian log-odds ratio measure under geodesic distance, i.e. Bayesian Logistic Shape Models or BLSMs in short, and it is applied within our L^3 method in place of existing solutions used in [1,2]. Secondly, we use a Laplacian Prior for regularising the final result obtained at the end stage when a model is fitted using Bayes\u2019 theorem. These methods are applied first to the task of automatic recognition of certain patterns on the human ear, specifically the landmarks which define what ear model(s) correspond to any given individual. After establishing their validity against manually identified ear feature points on real CT scans, results are then transferred over from this domain into the field of Computer Assisted Intervention or CAD/CAS guided surgery where they can solve similar problems related to soft tissue and bone structures as discussed above."

This dual solution approach was previously developed by its authors using a symmetric dual energy formulation (Cremers & Sapiro 2008) [1]. Due to physical limitations such as light reflection or lens aberrations that may introduce artefacts into imaging devices, we find it more relevant here by introducing such a specificity into our modelization scheme. This has been proven efficient especially when images exhibit high contrast borders. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate how to successfully apply this model under real world noise conditions, with high confidence levels even with low-resolution data which can be highly useful in certain applications fields like medical imagery analysis tasks as wells robotic surgery systems where precise tracking performances are required at each step and frame. Our experimental comparisons show some improvements over Cremers\u2019s previous work regarding time performances together better detection rates due this new asymmetry."

We show an interesting case where this drawback can be mitigated to achieve real time semantic segmentation by proposing a customized 58 layer architecture inspired by SqueezeDet++ called SqueezeSeg++. By carefully rethinking the use of feature extractor in BinarySemanticNet (BiSeNet), we aim at making our proposed network faster (36 ms inference per frame) while maintaining adequate precision. Moreover, with only one modification, we create a general purpose model trained end-toend to allow transferring learning across different domains such as road signs and medical images.

A key property of our approach is that all learning and recognition proceed at the level of raw RGB, alleviating the need for specialized data preprocessing or costly transforms required by approaches learned in higher representations. This capability opens up interesting possibilities for scaling computationally expensive neural network models to larger datasets (e.g., Google's billions of StreetView images). To demonstrate these capabilities we report experiments on a set of publicly available SceneGen data along with results of tracking specific types of objects across frames to show how different contextual clues cause the system to reorganize its understanding over time.

      "generation": "> In this work, we present an end to end method for semantic segmentation in which only weak supervision, in the form of unlabelled videos from the wild are required during training time. As such our new approach provides a powerful complement to fully supervised learning algorithms which require a large labelled dataset for each target class before they can be deployed in practice with high quality performance (see Fig 1). Here we use synthetic motion capture data at no cost but real data is also an option as long it contains accurate object motions and tracking information over frames or video shots. Our proposed system builds upon existing generative models for image synthesis by leveraging the underlying physics modelling that governs complex geometric shape transformations and visual properties between objects. We use a state of the art architecture called a Diffusion Generator Network (DGN) which was shown recently to provide superior sampling results than previous GAN based methods without being restricted by sample modes. Thus they can generate better diversity samples per batch while requiring only a single simple diffusion process compared to using hundreds of individual adversarial processes. Next, an efficient inference algorithm has been provided that allows the network to focus primarily on image reconstruction so to produce images closely matching input source observations while simultaneously conditioning them so they match some contextual background supplied either by additional inputs or by exploiting any available prior knowledge about specific classes including semantics. Using this inexpensive source context data along with unlabelled videos provides a principled way to enable semi-supervised transfer learning via self-training where model generated examples and their ground truth maps are used to augment the limited number of human labeled images typically found when adapting one supervised model into another domain. This represents both a significant saving and avoidance of tedious manual segmentation tasks. More importantly however we show that our learned dynamics allow us to generalize effectively out-of distribution on significantly different domains compared to other baselines e.g. even on scenes not trained explicitly, like under water scene depicted by Figure-d), while still preserving fine details like skin wrinkles accurately unlike most competitor approaches."

The detection of polyps is a challenging task due to the presence of various types of polyps with different shapes and sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for polyp localisation using ensemble learning based on classifier prediction confidence and comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation (CLPSO). The proposed approach consists of two stages: the first stage involves the use of a deep learning model to extract features from the input image, and the second stage involves the use of ensemble learning to combine the predictions of multiple classifiers. The ensemble learning approach is based on the prediction confidence of the classifiers, which is used to weight the predictions of each classifier. The CLPSO algorithm is used to optimise the weights of the classifiers in the ensemble. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset, which is a publicly available dataset for polyp localisation.

We use classifiers to obtain probability outputs during a feed-forward pass followed by the training of an ensemble framework using these probabilities. In particular, we leverage the output entropy (confusion) as an importance measure which reflects how confident a learner is about its decision while providing further information on classification errors that are inherent to all learners especially when they are subjected to overfitting or have poor generalization ability which causes the ensemble error floor effect. Furthermore, the performance of individual learners is degrading because they might be too similar with regard to their characteristics such as network structures and feature extraction abilities. Thus, it requires to investigate better ways so that good diversification can take place within itself. To address this problem we used the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation conceptualised by us along with hyper-tuning. This method helps identify diverse combinations between input parameters and their corresponding classifier models. It gives way for robust exploration of different regions in parameter space with more feasible choices ensuring higher exploitation accuracy without leading the search into any premature solution. Besides, due to the high diversity maintained in the search space throughout different generations, there will not only be less chance of the search being trapped in some specific region but also the exploration process continues until near optimal solutions are obtained."

      "generation": "> In this project, I worked individually and with mentors on developing a pneumonia segmentation model capable of training on multiple chest X-ray datasets with minimal architecture changes needed. I trained my models using three different methods (VGG16 CNNs, DenseNet201CNN's, U-net Architectures), and used them in order of preference to analyze each dataset separately as well as simultaneously. I tried two approaches; one was by taking my first dataset alone, and splitting it into smaller images and creating augmented versions of each image while utilizing overlapping data that would help my network generalize more efficiently. This method provided mixed results even though there were large datasets I could train on that included several subsets. My second approach was taken when I began working on other sets like Fast-Path (from Kaggle), MIMIC 2X, and NIH Chest X-Rays (NIHCXR). Before training all these new databases however, I combined them together before segmenting then added them along with my initial CXR-89 set. Because the CXR-89 database only focused on the lung regions, I had to make modifications upon loading additional segments so my CNN/U-Net output was consistent throughout (if not possible, defaulted back to lung masks)! My first attempt at training multi-set resulted in many errors because various issues occurred when transfer learning across datasets wasn't done properly... But after fixing most bugs we ran into by doing rigorous testing over time our final product performed remarkably better than anticipated given limited knowledge about deep neural networks coming into this project!! Overall this was an interesting experience due mostly due its challenge level, but overall felt satisfied knowing how much progress has been made already considering where things started off at ! Good luck if any fellow students come across similar problems down road too :) Happy coding everyone..!!"

However, in this work we propose self-supervised learning strategies via the idea that it may be able to learn useful representations under unstable training settings without relying upon manual annotation labels. By imprinting pixel information, our method could leverage both spatial location and local context features to discover underlying structures on various scene objects, thereby effectively distilling informative knowledge across pixels for subsequent network generalization. We conduct extensive experiments with different semantic tasks for object discovery (e.g., ImageNet) and region identification (e.g, COCO and Pascal VOC), with three standard few-shot segmentation frameworks. Our approach can improve overall accuracy by 3%~6%, meanwhile achieve consistent improvement over all classes, including average and tail performance. We further show that only few samples suffice at initialization stage for achieving comparable results with massive data, as well as the capability of transferring feature representation among datasets/tasks\n\n(Original Research Paper at arXiv:1807.02594)"

Our proposed method achieves high fidelity and fast run times, making it suitable for analyzing datasets with millions of cells. We demonstrate our approach on two challenging problems: (1) clustering neuronal nuclei which are often touching; and (2) counting cells when an object bounding box cannot be easily learned due to complex membrane structure, occlusion, etc...

      "generation": "> Automatic recognition and estimation of food portions are important components in image analysis applications ranging from nutrition surveillance to automatic restaurant billing, recipe search engines, consumer product evaluation tools. To date, deep learning models have predominantly dominated most computer vision tasks achieving state-of-theart performance on benchmark datasets. However, these works face several challenges when applied to real world settings due to significant domain shift, lack of expert annotated data, limited training resources as well as unconstrained nature of input samples. We show that adapting feature representations across domains leads to improved performance compared with supervised training using mono modalities. Additionally we present our findings that transferring style information from one domain to another while avoiding overfitting can lead to higher accuracy scores especially with large pre trained model architectures such as DeepLabv3+. Our results suggest superior performance in predicting class labels for different categories(eg. chicken tikka masala) as opposed to other segmentation techniques (instance/boundary). The method has potential application in real world setting by removing all human interventions in recognizing foods in uncontrolled environments (e.g food service industry)"

In many medical cases, patients would most likely be seen with various imaging devices from multiple hospitals within different regions or time periods in one's life span. This could pose challenges as there tend to be variations between image acquisition methods and modalities due to technical device issues leading to inconsistencies in data. Deep Neural Networks are highly parameterised which require large amounts of relevant labelled data prior to successful deployment. But how should a DNN model acquire enough labelled data so that both internal weight parameters adjustments and architectures stay consistent throughput all application lifecycle? Is it always possible to find enough labelled sample instances covering the complete range of unforeseeable variations during the entire period of use? This situation happens even worse when multiple kinds and brands of such image generating equipment are used across the geographic boundaries where medical resources might not be accessible. One way that is proven successfully by DoIT Pixel GAP in many practical applications was creating federate frameworks to integrate heterogenous institutions with their different proprietary software systems and interfaces such that patient information and images were able to be shared amongst them despite local policy rules and business constraints. Thus, our FedDG solution hereby incorporates multi-instance labelled datasets acquired from federating entities into one big picture. By using continual autoencoder technique firstly, the raw data undergoes preprocessing step before encoding stage during each new incoming dataset. At last decoding stage extract the useful features and embeddings representing the important content inside each source images such that they will have same representations regardless"

Semi-supervised learning methods can take advantage over fully supervised ones when only scarce labeled training examples are available but large amounts of unlabelled information are accessible at hand. In this paper we introduce the first method which effectively uses this additional information directly incorporated into its architecture and learns a consistent model of both tasks (image classification vs segmentation) by means of dual pathways. More specifically, our network simultaneously predicts labels between pixels according to their location within the images while distinguishing them based on similar patches embedded in each other via graph convolutional neural networks layers sharing weights. This way we avoid errors due to misclassification as well as improve discrimination of overlapping regions when segmenting multiple objects. We show that this duality improves overall performance on several publicly available medical image datasets. Furthermore, when no prior knowledge about the expected number or ratio of objects was given within the dataset our new class balancing method increased results by 10% compared to existing semi-supervised approaches even without fine tuned regularization hyperparameters thus providing better generalizability in a realworld setting."

Our experimental evaluation shows significant improvement over other state-of-the art adaptive method without requiring any labeled samples in both cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) segmentations tasks. We also evaluate the effectiveness by presenting various ablation studies highlighting key steps involved as well as the significance of our approach."

Therefore, learning from limited supervised data and then transferring this knowledge to unlabeled samples becomes crucial tasks for further clinical applications. In addition, selfsupervising models are important as these do not require any form of human feedback during training phases making them more suitable and easier in terms of both practicality and cost perspectives.

      "generation": "## Introduction\n\nFood image segmentation (FIS) has been widely used to automatically identify the content and estimate nutrition within an arbitrary food plate, so it can support automated recipe development as well as health monitoring in real environments. For this task, saliency masks are beneficial but no publicly available benchmarks have yet included them, which hinders comparison with current approaches. Moreover, there have been numerous successful applications recently that adopt sematic segmentations for multiple datasets across many categories, although these works fail when transferring to the specific application domain of FIS. However, unlike standard object classes, foods do not possess enough generalization features; instead they exhibit diverse shapes, colors, materials, styles or appearances due to different preparations/cooking methods. Thus, previous single object class-agnostic works often use pretrained deep models without adopting proper constraints while directly transferring to another dataset using common techniques like fine-tuning or self supervision, even though results demonstrate severe issues including inconsistencies on similar labels when tested elsewhere. By considering the above limitations we present a novel framework in both locality and consistency called Salient Class Aware Food Image Local and Global Embedding (SCAFILGE), which introduces various loss terms including auxiliary tasks (e.g., classification). We first transform input RGB images by concatenating the initial embeddings, gradient feature maps generated via high frequency decomposition network, together with salience outputted from the U-Net encoder pathway [1]. Since visual attention may fluctuate during cooking methods, such as the variation between raw ingredients vs. processed meals, the saliency map thus acts as prior knowledge when guiding the embedding features. Then a second transformation layer is applied. With improved discriminability from better feature representation through global residual blocks, all intermediate representations at the global level, along with gradients obtained from each scale in a convolutional block with depthwise separable convolutions and adaptive average poolings in local space, act as inputs to two separate neural networks responsible for class predictions and pixel-level refinement masks respectively. Finally, joint losses combine a pixel-wise L1 term using the final embedding vectors outputted followed by logit class weighting of foreground-background probability outputs and cross entropy losses, so"

We show that corruption resistance is particularly important when using imperfect image datasets available today, and our approach provides reliable results where existing state-of-the-arts fail at label correction due to low quality dataset noise. In particular, we demonstrate (1) very good performance compared to other approaches while being able to handle 3 different levels of data contamination - i.e., up to ~75% misclassified pixels; (2) improved performance over several baseline methods as well as related models through detailed analysis and visual comparison, including segmenting images under label flipping, swapping, removal, and addition attack; finally (3), consistent improvement even on clean dataset segmentations without any corruption applied, highlighting its overall superiority against these baseline approaches."

For domain adaptation (DA), these obstacles are accentuated by additional modeling challenges associated with handling cross-dataset shifts and feature distribution differences between source and targets domains. DA techniques have therefore been limited either at the time of training (e.g., adversarial training) or model deployment (transfer via pretrained weights or rearchitecting). We propose an approach that overcomes these limitations using knowledge-distillation to transfer information contained within pretrained image segmentation networks into unconstrained network backbone structures designed specifically to achieve fast running times via miniaturization without prior specialization on medical data or other similar datasets. This method is then evaluated using three different student architectures on 10 different tasks that were derived from 4 publicly available image segmentation benchmarks - ISLES, MSDV26, MRBrainS13 and ADNI Brains dataset. Our results demonstrate that our approach greatly improves upon standard performance achieved when leveraging pretrained convolutional neural networks alone."

Following recent works which have advocated that this additional prior can be useful to alleviate difficulties like occlusions or lighting variations when applied jointly with standard non-supervised density estimation based image clustering algorithms, we use it here within an unsupervised graph partitioning formulation that allows the definition of a large scale number of clusters at various degrees of granularity according to the local size of segments detected. As our proposed model contains only few parameters relative to CD, no optimization procedure is necessary for its fine tuning but one can simply adapt it easily given specific constraints to handle for a particular application with a high level of confidence on the results obtained. This approach has been validated experimentally on different datasets showing good performances."

Specifically, our network is divided into two modules. In module one, features are extracted from 16 neighboring points for each input query point by leveraging pointwise learnable MLP layers followed with dilated residual networks (ResNet) architecture that uses skip connections between low-level and high-level representation learning units. The ResNet encoder transforms the point set of an object/surface into encoded boundary patch representations called Point-Level Patch. Once these patches arrive at module two, they pass through a localization module which computes rotational distances between all pairs to further encode their spatial relationships as Local Distance Feature (LDF). These LDF features are then used to predict class probabilities through classifier head. Based on our extensive experiments on three benchmarks datasets including Stanford Large-Scale (SLS), ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, our method shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while being able to produce competitive results using shallow versions than competing models.

To address inconsistent interpretations between modalities during image processing tasks, we propose a cross-modal consistency constrained multi-task autoencoder (ICMSC) for generalizing deep models beyond target domains with unlabeled images without changing their annotation schemes and model architectures. We empirically demonstrate that ICMSC could effectively tackle two scenarios in varying degrees of pixel level shifts between synthesized hip joint bone segmentation datasets (syn2HIP45). Firstly, it shows superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines as both unimodal and crossdomain generalization performance significantly increases by at least 10percent in FwIOU and Dice scores under three major test categories based on different modalities and numbers of training examples(i.e., high level/low variation in radiographs; midlevel quality /midvariation in CT scans ; low level quality /high variance in surface renderings). Secondly, our analysis on intermediate representations indicates that ICMSC also demonstrates good robustness against domain misalignments, resulting in improved prediction accuracy across all domains even with few training data."

This is not a bad thing but it does bring its concerns about whether or if we should simply implement something like that just because the author claims that he tested his new idea over several deep learning architectures (both image recognition related ones along with cnn-based 3d neural networks) while claiming decent accuracy without a huge sacrifice in terms of computational resources when compared to training such models with a standard implementation of convolutional layers where no pruning is done inside any layer of your model (kernel shrinking does allow you to achieve this effect). As far as the claim of reduced memory requirement goes, according to the authors' experimental results which they presented in Fig. 7 (left), they say that they managed to reduce their total parameter size by about half (for example going from nearly 5 million parameters to under 2.5m) without affecting accuracy too severely. But note though that these experiments are conducted within specific settings set forth by each individual application; so it might actually end up being slightly different after applying this method onto another network topology than what was used during those tests mentioned again! You\u2019ll also want consider how many weights will exist once more weight sharing occurs among filters before making final judgement call whether this approach would work well enough overall!"

      "generation": "Medical image segmentation plays an important role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning [1]. However, due to the variability of scanning devices and human conditions, manual segmentation is often subjective between clinicians or even impossible to experts in some situations such as early detection on CT images. In this context, the development of automatic segmentation approaches based upon deep learning has recently led to significant improvements in many studies, such as UNet architecture [2] and generative adversarial networks (GANs) including Conditional Fully Generative Attentional Network (Conditional UNET), Cycle GAN and Self Ensemble Supervised Learning(SESL). A series of these algorithms have achieved excellent results in various applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT), etc. These experiments were carried out under ideal circumstances because their training data volumes are relatively large. While only providing limited medical reports for training is too risky without sufficient understanding of how patients' physical changes may significantly affect segmentations at different stages of lesion progresses. Inspired by recent findings that most of medical images share common structure features regardless of image size and resolution [3], we exploit the power of self-supervised transformer to learn global representation in multi-modal medical segmentation task while only having access with very little labeled data. Following this pipeline, our architecture shows promising results on chest/abdomen CT and pancreas MRI. Specifically, on 2D cross-sectional images containing both organs in 5 cases (36 slices): mean dice scores are higher than 94% on 18 slices; On whole-body CT images (pilot study of 100 cases with more than one organ labelings at Lung, Liver, Colon& Rectum levels), the accuracy rate can reach 97%. And 93% on 5 liver cirrhosis and HCC MRIs(whole volumn+organ masks provided), respectively. As far as we know with similar amount of labels, there no algorithm reported comparable metrics yet."

Recent works have proposed multi-modal learning approaches with supervised models that aim at predicting clinical outcomes using heterogeneous data (imaging modality, anatomical location, disease), thus improving both prediction performance and accuracy in personalized medicine. Nevertheless, few labeled examples may be also available when learning multiple representations derived from unseen patient instances whose phenotype cannot be predicted accurately unless the model learns directly through examples rather than relying on prior biases encoded by handcrafted representations of features extracted manually. In this article, we propose few shot learning methods based on recursive architectures comprising bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) able to learn generic medical image representation under different conditions. We use sparse coding for clustering visual vocabulary followed by stacked denoising autoencoder for generative pretraining tasks to generate low dimensional embedding vectors serving as auxiliary variables required to train RBM parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our BRNN can learn feature abstraction layers while generating new semantics from low level descriptors, leading to promising results compared w/ supervised counterparts when transferring knowledge over medical datasets. Finally, our approach enables effective inter-class segmentations between different regions within brain MRI scans and between organ lesion boundaries observed across different organs such as the liver.

Our method builds on two major strategies, disentanglement and alignment of representations across modalities (images and labels) that are known to be beneficial especially in SSL scenarios. Disentangled modules capture spatial patterns at different levels, which leads to a separation of high level information like object appearance and low-level structures like texture or color with their relations while they can focus more on global semantics of objects than local details using pixel-based losses (cross entropy). Alignment improves feature representation quality via constraining dissimilarity between paired features while also improving discriminative power during training by enforcing thematic similarities within modalities. In addition, these modules allow the model to explore and exploit richer semantic space without relying as heavily solely on labeled datasets thus contributing significantly towards robustness over few labeled images with additional benefit of better performing on scarce class instances. We show on popular biomedical image segmentation datasets including ISIC 2019 skin lesion dataset and MSD liver cancer histopathology dataset our models generalize well despite very limited number of labeled examples available for certain classes and outperforms both standard U-Net architecture and other advanced versions specifically optimized with labeled data alone; for example by achieving better Jaccard indices of up to $83\\%$."

Current literature mainly resorts to unlabeled data, in which information redundancy leads to degraded performance compared with fully (super)vised settings while the label noise problem still remains. To address the mismatch between teacher's labeling on small datasets and student's actual observations at inference stage, we propose a novel Student-Teacher framework that enables semi-supervised training by adaptively blending the teacher labels provided on the whole dataset with self learned pseudo-labels produced over both labeled and unlabbeled patient studies through ensemble classification. Unlike traditional models learning to minimize discrepancies against predefined pseudo-labels only, our proposal has two main advantages - it can flexibly scale up or down the size of source domain without relying on any heuristic method, so as to facilitate efficient knowledge transfer even under limited labeled data cases; more importantly, our unique design further allows the target model directly make use of true positive instances from either cleanly segmented normal CT brain slices within the same cohort, or weakened but still informative annotations from patients with poor quality ground truth contours in its own, thus achieving significantly better performances. Our evaluation results show that TST performs consistently well across five different medical imagery modalities and nine benchmark sets containing up to 13M scans and involving diverse tasks."

The HS-block can be easily integrated into existing CNN architectures to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed HS-block on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

      "generation": "We propose an architecture called HS-ResNet, using hierarchically split residual block to enhance feature representation in CNNs without losing model capacity or generalization performance. In this proposed method, channels are split into multiple paths by factorizing the residuals into hierarchies and aggregated using subsets of these residual connections at layerwise levels. Such pathways can either be applied over all layers or just selected ones, while training parameters only depend on how many pathways were introduced in each layer. Our work proves that through such simple modifications we introduce extra depth without hurting model capacity too much which enables us to greatly increase model size while reaching better accuracy compared to conventional ResNets as it provides more learning power on deeper networks. We demonstrate our method with various datasets including ImageNet2 classification task where ResNeXt 50 - 64x64 shows very competitive performance in Top1 error rate compared to stateof\u2010the-art ResNets even when having significantly less number of parameters (e.g., Google/InceptionResNetV2 with nearly two times higher). This implies large scale deep neural nets could train faster due to its memoryfootprint advantage. We also show this improvement can extend across applications by evaluating CIFAR10 objectrecog\u2010nition task wherein our hierarchical splitting technique gives considerable resultsin terms of accuracy. For example, with same computational resource budget the accu\u2010racy gap between a modified RX-50 vs. vanilla Goo\u2010gleNet V2 reduces around 9%."

To achieve this we adapt the Metabox active learning framework into MetaBox+ by incorporating the region's aspect ratio within its decision making process. By means of experimentation over two prominent global scale datasets, we compare our algorithm against its parent model and some related works finding out MetaBox+ performs better when prioritized foreground categories possess high elongated shapes than circles or squares.

In particular, this paper addresses the question how content features should be incorporated into existing user interfaces for object identification. Specifically we focus the problem of automatic propagation of markings across pattern repetitions for efficient manual segmentation. This method employs standard user inputs (i.e., strokes) as seeds and augments them with gradient vectors computed at multiple scales [1]. By employing both vector direction and magnitude we capture structural characteristics from which we compute localized correlation measures between images through 3D convolutional filter banks.

Analyzing these lazily labeled data allows us to learn an initial model as a warmstarter to then retrain again supervised after selecting some examples where manual correction can be given.

Then, multiple views are further used to reconstruct a wall atlas based on the estimated output.

Overall, our network contains six main components including encoder / decorder layers, deformable sampling module, wall detection module, label estimation and boundary map generation modules, voxel reconstruction module, and atlas generator with back projector. We developed three loss functions involving weighted average cross entropy, dice coefficient, and soft Dice coefficienct losses between ground truth and predictions, respectively. Our proposed architecture was trained by two datasets with diverse acquisition protocols. One consists of MPEGVQA coronal reformatted raw scans with various contrast media injecton schemes while the other includes axial scans which were acquired during pre-contrast or inversion recovery phases after injection. As the final step, predicted masks were refined via connected component analysis followed by morphological postprocessing.\n> Results Experiments showed good generalization abilities across different modalites.

Attractor-based CA, namely Turing Machine CA and one dimensional binary 2 to state CA, are employed in this work, where spatial interactions are incorporated into a new model that improves the efficiency of previous solutions. Moreover our method incorporates multi-layer neural networks with shared connectivity within each layer so as to be able to detect complex patterns such as objects with curved contours or similar shapes with different sizes present at numerous scales in a natural image. An interesting aspect of our formulation is that it can be easily tailored towards any computer vision task which employs local convolutional features followed by non linear classification techniques. Experimental results show that we significantly improve performance over existing competing methods on several widely used benchmarks while operating at high computational speed comparable to traditional machine learning techniques."

To alleviate this problem, in recent years, there have been an increased interest exploring various semi-supervision approaches that are able to utilize some unlabeled data along with limited paired sample (a.k.a labeling). In such settings, however, it remains challenging to leverage structural shape priors to train more accurate models given only superficial signals in unpaired samples. In this paper, we propose two simple yet effective strategies inspired by our human vision system to integrate external structural shape priors into our semi-supervised network design to increase segmentation accuracy. Our proposed method can automatically discover meaningful structures or similar shapes within images across different modalities thus significantly improving intermodality domain dissimilarity, while ensuring consistency with the predicted pairwise outputs during the training process. We demonstrate that our simple architecture outperforms many complex frameworks as measured by both quantitative metrics and visual comparisons.\nSource: arxiv.org"

Our model can be used as a general tool for assigning attributes or words (e.g., \u201cchair\u201d, \u201cred\u201d ...) to any given part within an image. A strong point of our approach is that we leverage human expert knowledge by leveraging existing object proposals with high scores, while focusing more resources on the few difficult cases (a.k.a. outliers). Compared to classical methods where features are selected by manual intervention such selection can easily scale up to thousands of objects making the task computationally unfeasible for large data sets containing millions of images like Places2. Consequently the ability to learn meaningful visual representations even under this limitation enables us to achieve good performance without having fine- grained supervision per-pixel levels even though the overall label space remains very coarse. In summary we show how weakly labelled data can be handled efficiently using novel clustering algorithms with fast convergence properties and demonstrate significant improvements over other approaches relying only on standard CNNs on benchmark datasets showing potential towards fully automated solutions."

In addition to expensive tool life determination experiments conducted on shop floor test machines, other factors such as material property data, product specifications, machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate), tool shape complexity, clamping pressure, etc also affect tool life [3]. While researchers have long been working towards automated tool condition monitoring techniques using acoustic emission sensors and accelerometers that detect tool wear progression by analysing these data in real time [8], the lack of robust analysis methods limits their scalability to practical manufacturing environments. To improve upon this situation, we present an uncertainty reduction based approach called UBACTW (UnCertainty Based AcoustiCal Tool WEear) where machine vibration and tool acoustic behaviour analysis can enable reliable predictions on remaining tool life and aid prognostics during ongoing cutting operations. By learning from human expert interaction and user preferences over different combinations of decision making algorithms and feature selection criteria, our framework addresses some critical issues associated with developing predictive models that are interpretable or explainable. As part of future work, UBACTW will be extended through multimodal sensor fusion techniques to monitor both physical condition and quality defects to further enhance its usability, reliability and utility across various types of industrial applications."

      "generation": "> Abstract \u2013 We present Fully HYPERBOLIC ConvNets (FHyCnets), in which we explore how hyperbolic space could improve on the performance of convolution neural networks, that are currently built using Euclidean spaces. In particular, motivated by the recently proposed N-d Sphere nets and h-hyperbolic nets work, we analyze the potential gains obtained when replacing standard convolutions, also referred to as cross correlation operations under unitary linearity preserving transformations, with their corresponding counterparts defined across general Riemannian Manifolds, notably the Poincar\u00e9 Ball (PB) model, for hyperbolic distances. Based on this geometrical abstraction that offers increased dimensionality at small distances while it decreases it beyond limits set by some maximum radius value defined prior, it appears that significant efficiency gains can be expected based only over minor changes made to the architecture used within current convnet systems. In essence what we show here is that just like its planer analogue, that was observed previously to excel at image recognition tasks thanks mainly to its properties offering significantly more storage capacity than its flatter equivalent, the same holds true even further so in higher dimensions but again over hyperbolically rather than spherically convex surfaces.\n>\n> One promising observation worth mentioning, in addition to the ones we have already been quoted stating, is the fact that unlike conventional deep learning architectures, such an idea provides great scope towards achieving superior results not just per layer across single or relatively shallow depths alone but instead, via simple additive extensions throughout entire sequences along larger total breadths too. With this said though I will caution before drawing any conclusions one way or another until more testing has been done yet still given all other things being equal there exist strong indicators suggesting certain benefits may well come down primarily due largely because FHCN\u2019s are much faster computationally speaking relative most common models found today especially those involving multiple hidden layers; even if only very slightly quicker speeds matter quite greatly considering recent advances seen among competing technologies outdoing ours lately almost always seem tied directly back up against whatever advantages gained through improved speed rather anything else related specifically functionality wise first hence why we need look closely into improving upon ours where time takes precedence above"

      "generation": "---\n> \u2751 The accuracy and reliability of label annotations are crucial to the development of medical image segmentation algorithms, where models trained under one domain (i.e., source or target) often exhibit poor generalization performance on images taken from another unseen setting (i.e., transfer). Although several methods have been proposed against the negative impact of noisy labels during training, it remains challenging for them to effectively deal with cross-domain data shifting simultaneously (due to annotation variabilities between sources/targets), specifically for semantic segmentation tasks that demand higher precision to interpret human tissues' information than other regression-like ones like object detection do. In this study, we propose a new network equipped with Cross-Denoise Residual Network blocks (CDRNs) over shared feature layers of encoders. CDRN modules can remove corruptions inside features brought by corrupted labels while performing learning progress properly due to their ability to adapt themselves through an adjustable weight coefficient $c^*$. Particularly, the outputs produced by CDRNs serve as intermediate results at each time step without affecting the flow across levels within current or upstream residual paths. We also show how these modules improve the robustness level of target training in dealing with labeled noises inherent as well as those introduced by unfamiliar domains from the source (unsupervised learning) via self-learning operations at different scales and granularities. Results of extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms a wide range of recent existing competitors [1] significantly on multi-dataset benchmarks, including 18 publicly available CT, MRI datasets, and two private lung ultrasound scans.\n### Introduction [2][3]:\n\u2796 Medical AI technologies are making rapid advances based on deep neural networks which have become essential tools empowering most of these studies.

Surgery simulation makes it possible by reconstructing 6 dof robot pose with respect to CAD models or segmented images via augmented reality (AR). However, some major problems still need solutions due to insufficient understanding of spatial configuration of organs and tissues within body such as poor accuracy using AR or virtual image distortion when projective matrices are estimated from 2d information with depth cameras only like RGB-D sensors commonly applied previously. We have proposed Elastic Boundary Projection that solves the problem efficiently by recovering a deformable surface around 3D meshes. To deal with uncertainties in physical interaction process, we apply machine learning methods rather than traditional mathematical optimization techniques based on mesh matching algorithm. As evaluation procedure, synthetic data generated by NVIDIA Dataset Pipeline was adopted while experiments were conducted both computationally (by computer resources) and clinically (with medical specialists).

This boundary direction exploits that there exists certain boundaries among those pixels within multiple scales because most objects have their clear and distinguishable contours between object and background from close up views while their contour would be blurred when viewing at far distance (similar to what you see when looking through binoculars). Our method effectively segments out the target object from both foreground and background without using binary masks or any heuristic rules in contrast to other deep learning based methods such as FPN and Mask R-CNN. Therefore we eliminate extra complex computations associated to binary masks and can greatly enhance segmentation speed due to elimination of multi scales of computing involved in FPN and Mask R-CNN to reduce total number of flops by 80%. Furthermore, no extra training data like MS COCO or Pascal VOC2012 is needed for our model's learning since it utilizes the same datasets used to train original ResNet152 in contrast with others which require extensive use of these two extra training sets. Experiments with various applications are conducted showing good comparisons against Mask R-CNN."

We propose using traditional method inspired deep learning framework, which includes pre-training with Canny edge detector before fine tuning by edge detection problem for an excellent feature extraction capability without excessive use of labeled training samples. We further adopt sparse autoencer neuron structure [3] after last layer to reduce model complexity and thus enhances interpretation capabilities with similar performance compared to conventional fully connected softmax classifier for edge detection task. A publicly available database for general purpose, Berkeley Segmentation Dataset was used for object segmentation study while MVSEC car edge dataset was employed in this work to demonstrate its applicability on real world problems. Experimental results show competitive accuracies achieved by our Traditionally motivated DCCN(TMDCNN), 79% and 86%, for Berkeley segmentation dataset and Car-edge datasets respectively. It indicates TMDCNN's suitability towards solving many vision related task requiring high computational demand especially during its early stages of exploration such as visual odometry[].

Despite many empirical successes over common design choices such as Xavier or Kaiming Initializers as well as data independent random normalization schemes (e.g., $\\mathcal{D}$=512), the theoretical understanding of when an explicit vs implicit learning scheme will work best remains relatively underdeveloped, especially within computer vision settings with non-trivial segmentation task objectives given images where both semantic and class information are important. Prior analyses have focused more on image classification tasks relying solely on pixel content information without object boundaries, as well as very high input dimensions and shallow convolutional models at early phases of development. We ask whether standard architectural guidelines such the number of starting layers should be revised depending upon model size? Would deeper initialization layers yield gains using larger datasets and higher resolution images (simulating state-of-the-art 2048 x 3968 images)? Can we develop algorithms that leverage this initial layer uncertainty to improve global convergence characteristics by encouraging early growth while avoiding trivial optimization solutions which often dominate traditional batch gradient descent / momentum based objective functions? In this workwe provide answers to these questions via extensive experimentation across diverse dataset scenarios involving different resolutions and varying segmentations across multiple real world domains including natural images, medical images and satellite imagery. This provides us direct access regarding effective ways for researchers to incorporate various deep network initialization schemes based on their own application context which has been previously missing in literature."

We focus on importance-driven based methods for model compression as they provide a systematic framework allowing us to address various issues that may arise when dealing with data from multiple domains such as different statistics or scale differences. First we show how a naive use of model updating scheme used during pruning can lead to suboptimal results due to ignoring changes occurring at high-level layers of the network responsible for interpreting objects' shapes, their pose and colors. Secondly we observe that standard metric chosen for retraining of each subset of model parameters leads again towards overall decrease of performance measured in terms of segmentations accuracy. In order to overcome problems associated with both issues, proposed solutions involve careful design of an objective function accounting for two sources of error: 1) prediction errors and 2) importance magnitude gaps between source and target samples. Our experimental findings underline benefits of both approaches by confirming higher quality of learned semantic object models compared with baseline systems without using adapted objective functions, yielding gains exceeding 3 points mIoU over a commonly used evaluation metric even when working simultaneously with images taken from ImageNet PASCAL VOC challenge dataset and Google Cars dataset differing not only in training sets but also in number and types of classes. Since our approach was designed to generalize across diverse datasets it allows easy adaptation to new segmentation tasks requiring no further adjustments thus making its practical usage straightforward. Besides these promising results we would like to emphasize that additional experiments suggest possible further directions on exploiting the presented framework within particular real world scenarios having strong class overlap property."

Furthermore, the selection of number of segments K can affect the results due to its sensitivity towards local maxima. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that employs fuzzy c means clustering with adaptive particle swarm optimization(FPSOFCM). Firstly, global optimum values are found by initialisation with all possible choices of K from 2 to N, where N represent number of pixels. Next, based on mean shift vector, seed points and membership grades are obtained respectively and the global optimal value is used as the partition matrix. Then, the entire process discussed above is iteratively performed to find better approximation of clustered images until desired number of clusters are found locally. Results reveal excellent performance compared against existing methodologies when tested on standard image datasets IEEE-13 and MIT Indoor and outdoor database.

Traditional semantic segmentation models only rely on grayscale pixel values and do not have enough information to handle noise easily and are still over-sensitive to texture in images or blur due to missing information at different scales. Using hierarchical features from top- down in FLOCNet can improve model robustness to different noises due to low resolution and high-frequency signals during upsampling and deblurring steps after training by cascaded layers like DINO, while the skip connection ensures that it could transfer high frequency signals as needed and generate smoothing functions by mixing pixels across deep hierarchy with shallow level details. This will allow us to obtain an excellent balance between preserving detail and removing artifacts. Our proposed method requires very few parameters because our proposed network architecture has fewer blocks than traditional architectures and does not employ dense connections so it\u2019s faster and uses less memory which makes training easier even if you have less GPU VRAM capacity. We experimentally analyzed our approach based on two public datasets including one dataset collected from Google Drive sharing link provided here \u2013 https:// drive .google .com / file/ d/ 1CZ5G0QQrOIh26Tk8VXU7b_jKa4MNZDWfA9eCj3XfYLU1F35nT?usp=sharing . There were also some tests made using another dataset consisting of handwritten notes written as part of assignments submitted by many undergraduate students enrolled into math course MAP1131 at UCI who used them primarily for practice purposes only; this allowed testing how they performed against actual exam papers taken later throughout multiple years since both contain real world examples unlike synthetic ones found online where every example looks exactly alike creating artificial situations impossible outside machine learning algorithms context itself which limits their ability accurately modeling real life scenarios requiring more realistic samples instead otherwise known behavior won't emerge properly leading overall poor results being generated despite having perfect input quality!"

For this, we present a novel model known as Deep Grouping (DG) which works by assigning scores to every possible permutations on groups in a topology preserving manner -- and then learns hierarchical structures over these partitions. Our method uses only unary features with no hand-crafted feature representations making it practical and robust across different data sets from multiple domains. Experimental results show state-of-the art performance compared against several other methods (e.g., ENS [5], SLIC [146]) while offering low computational complexity. In particular, our deep learning framework achieves 70% higher FME scores than the existing state-of-the-art semantic parsing algorithms such as MCL with less memory requirements. Finally, our approach also significantly outperforms all current methods in terms of Mean Square Error while being an order of magnitude faster since computing grouping energy requires much fewer number of pairwise operations on each pixel."

      "generation": "### Abstract\n\nIn this work, we consider problems in which training instances are annotated using structured labels. A commonly encountered situation that falls into this category can be found when trying to identify and learn about different species within images (or videos) using automated means through classification based machine learning algorithms such as deep convolutional networks. For example, one might label each pixel with its corresponding ground truth specie or label sets of 16 * 16 sized blocks inside an image with classes like \u201cseashore\u201d, \u201criver bank\u201d etc.. These ground-truth annotations could possibly contain noise since they have been labelled by human experts who may not agree on classifications unanimously\u2014a phenomenon known generally referred to simply as inter-annotator disagreement [9]. This problem has been widely studied under other names e.g., crowd labeling, noisiest labeled data and more recently in machine learning literature where it is called noisily labeled data . Most approaches usually assume low levels/noise while few methods were able solve the ill conditioned overfitting setting induced by extremely noisy labels at higher error rates without imposing strong assumptions. In recent years researchers have taken approaches centered around estimating soft versions of the true underlying labels which enable them recover good estimates despite extreme settings where only 50% accuracy was possible between actual values. Here we will propose extensions to these models allowing us exploit high level structures observed in our dataset i.e., groupings among examples via their similarity or co-occurrences with other members so that they cannot all represent different instances but rather reflect common patterns shared across many objects belonging simultaneously both together as well individually thus helping avoid false positives when there exists multiple similar types having nearly equal probabilities assigned even though each individual one maybe hard distiguishable enough especially given finite amount features available per object instance . Although this additional knowledge does not remove entirely risk involved due to errors being introduced during initial phase caused perhaps partly because we relied solely upon manual labelers instead relying mainly computers\u2019 ability detect similarities"

Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Neural Style Transfer Loss Function based GAN as another main contribution that overcomes several limitations existing in previous works like color shift or blurry content which are commonly seen during the learning process for higher resolutions or more complicated styles.

Attention mechanism brings great success to many fields such as computer vision, machine translation etc. However, applying it to medical tasks in general, especially MRI segmentation, which faces with extreme data imbalance issue, would be very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new framework, named Multi-Scale Self Guidance Network ($MSSGNet$), that addresses these issues by combining both pixel-wise and contextual cues at different scales. Concretely, two parallel subnetworks are developed by using ResUnet10 as backbone structures followed by novel proposed self guided modules respectively that can help improve feature representation learning via attending regions of interest automatically from input images at coarse levels directly instead of expensive label maps. Further, the cross module interactions will enrich useful information for precise localization of boundary details across them by multi scale up-sampling layers as well as an extra global average-pooled branch. Specifically, on $AVA \\_{Dataset}$, our network achieved better performance than all existing networks including most recently published ones without increasing computational costs significantly. And, when benchmarking against other methods based on ablation studies within the same resource allocation settings, $MSSGNet$ exhibited obvious advantages over others, clearly showing its power in fusing complementary feature extractors to fully exploit both detailed information from pixels as well as rich structural knowledge from labels adaptively when needed."

      "generation": "> An important issue in medical field concerns the segmentation problem that consists in finding 2D slices or 3D volumes of tissues among images coming from CT/MRI scanners; automatic approaches try to deal with this by using data driven statistical models, such as Markov Random Field (MRF) models [18]. In an application oriented view, these approaches provide good results because they include specific informations of the analyzed objects. However the use of hand crafted features can be suboptimal when it comes choosing relevant features depending on the specific object under investigation and the classifier used afterwards. From the computer science perspective (where most state of the art techniques are born), machine learning based methods take advantage of modern computers equipped with multi-core hardware and GPU accelerator cards enabling massively parallel computation thus making possible the training of deep artificial neural network architectures which have achieved superior performance in many applications like speech recognition [5] and natural scene classification [4], demonstrating great potential in image and shape analysis tasks [6][7]. Deep convidential neural networks [9-10] represent hierarchical multilayered architectures, each layer taking as input only a subset of its upper neighbor\u2019s output activations. This scheme allows both low computational cost (a high portion of the weights has already been computed when calculating higher level feature maps so no back propagated errors have to recompute them when computing lower level ones) and improved optimization capabilities due to lower dimensional objective functions minimized during supervised optimizations steps . Each layer produces outputs with more complex interpretable patterns than their predecessors that combine simple learned rules at fine scales into holistic understanding of images contents at coarse levels, similar to those in the human visual system . This leads to effective representations while allowing the model to capture nonlinear relations between inputs. In contrast to earlier CNN implementations based on linear combinations of neighborhoods and filters without any spatial regularity assumptions, recent works showed that adding sparseness constraints enforcing the selection of few discriminatory pixels within image windows strongly improves accuracy even if not considering long range interactions[7]. To further improve this idea we propose to relax classical sparsenemess constraints leading to some degree of interaction"

      "generation": "Pixellated images, such as segmented brain MRIs or histopathology slides, are increasingly present in clinical machine learning data sets and other applications. We refer to these data examples as v-images (volumetric images), since they represent pixel values that encode an underlying distribution over discrete volumes. In this paper we propose vOpttrans, which incorporates entropy regularized optimal mass transport as a principled method for estimating densities within v-image segments by accounting for their spatially varying volumetric distributions. Unlike existing methods that either discretize density information on every grid point (\"nonparametric\"), require expert knowledge of a parametric form (\"semiparametric\") or assume uniformly distributed backgrounds/foregrounds, vOpttrans directly estimates each v-image's underlying discrete volume distribution. Our approach uses novel non-iterative entropic relaxation algorithms inspired from a recent class of work that regularizes Wasserstein distance objectives based on variational optimization [C2018;L2016], and makes use of new, non-trivial extensions developed herein including: non-smooth, stochastic optimizers, computations of sublevel set functions via piecewise linear approximations and application of multidimensional numerical integration rules to address multiple-dimensional marginalizations needed when handling color channels and 3D volumes. For example, our experiments demonstrate state of the art performance when applied to semseg+challenge [BLSFGWZ19] benchmarks for dense prediction tasks over pixellated medical MRI imagery, even competing favorably against deep supervision models that rely upon high cost training regimes requiring heavy domain transfer learning and large amounts of supervisory signals per class obtained through expensive manual labeling efforts to avoid catastrophic overfitting. Finally, the authors hypothesize that our technique has the potential to enable fast training and parameter reduction of supervised and unsupervised generative networks applied widely across emerging computer vision applications reliant on synthetic data generation."

In this work we address these problems by introducing a new approach that can be also adapted on other domains by applying transfer learning techniques based on weights fine tuning strategies. An effective way to use this approach was found using separable convolution filters instead of fully connected ones for feature extraction and segmenting process of detected fake regions of interest, which allowed us faster training times due its lower number of parameters compared to standard CNNs while preserving high detection accuracy results obtained on popular benchmark datasets such as AI Challenge 2019 dataset Vid4Motion, Wavelet Video Benchmark Dataset."

Specifically, statistical tests to ensure that these image segmentations are valid tend not to use accurate error bounds. In this work we build on selective inference, an idea introduced by Liu et al.\\ (\\emph{Journal ASLA}, 2018), and generalize it to show how certain filter network architectures can be leveraged for exact inference. For example, we discuss three common structures called U-, Unet{}--, and Full-Convolution networks and derive their corresponding expressions which enable us to infer whether or not a test statistic $\\sigma$ exceeds its critical value $\\tau$, denoted as $H_1$. Our formulation relies on the assumption that each unit represents independent random effects drawn from distributions known beforehand and does not require distributional assumptions made about the images themselves. We also describe techniques to leverage information across units when more data is available; i.e., if one wishes, via resampling methods like subsampled bootstrap or cross validation, to exploit observations beyond those on current layer, while still maintaining exact conditional coverages for all layers under investigation (see Section \\ref{sec:infer}). With respect to other existing solutions such as Monte Carlo dropblock we emphasise our method's theoretical rigour through asymptotic approximation error analysis followed by numerical evaluations demonstrating high quality estimates throughout an extensive range of different situations: varying datasets and problem dimensions - both finite sample errors showing good agreement between theory versus simulations (i.e,, small deviation from optimal coverage probability). Furthermore, unlike alternative computation based implementations discussed earlier where either computational efficiency would significantly decline during iterative calculations involving covariance matrices being recomputed over every iteration steps resulting into lengthy execution times compared against proposed approach requiring minimal update time irrespective regardless what kind distribution settings applied upon input vector(s) during implementation process itself hence making them suitable tools whenever efficient processing power requirement constraints arise due lack availability sufficient server resources running required programs internally at local host site locations.."

      "generation": "> Many real-world applications in the computer vision domain can be cast as tasks where the goal is to generate visual content conditioned on text, audio or video. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) that utilize conditional latents have proven effective at capturing diverse data distribution of such modalities including faces [1], human poses [2] and voice audio [3]. However, GANs are less successful when it comes to generating objects with complex shapes, multiple elements and/or precise spatial layouts. In this work, we propose a solution tailored towards overcoming the deficiencies mentioned above; specifically addressing the problem of image collage generation using a memory attentive network. We tackle guided mode problems \u2014 when the contents of the desired output image are known precisely \u2014 by proposing an attention-based generative model tailored towards such scenarios; enabling high fidelity reconstruction even with imperfect guidance signals and generalizing across novel input conditions . Additionally, by applying our method to unguided settings - also termed compositions -we demonstrate competitive state-of-the-art performance on two different datasets: image-image composition generated upon simple keywords[4]; and non-image compositions \u2014 including geometric sketches and hand-traced images, which pose greater challenges due to lack of fine resolution and limited amount of training examples."

      "generation": "## Introduction\n\nThe use of machine learning, and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has recently shown promise with regards to automating certain manual tasks related to radiotherapy planning via segmentation [1]. For instance, several studies exist which are focused on automatic prediction of rectal volume before application of radiation therapy during prostate cancer treatment, utilizing both MRI and CT data sets [2][3] . Despite these advancements, clinical applicability at present remains an issue because training these models requires large image databases as well as clinician involvement over considerable time periods. This leads to difficulty applying these methods more widely due to increased costs for their continued maintenance. We propose that by exploiting predefined structures delineated by physicians for other purposes, we can improve not only the speed but also ease of incorporation of automated segmentation into routine workflows thereby reducing costly labor requirements associated with segmentation. Currently many medical imaging facilities provide predefining of particular organ volumes or regions of interest. An example of this is using contrast enhanced images for determining tumor extent of malignancy through radiological assessment when creating a 4DCT scan. As part of developing this idea further, it would be interesting if there were ways of combining information regarding structure outlines automatically derived from other resources within a facility together with the CNNs currently being investigated. Specifically, any relevant structure from prior patient histories could potentially be integrated so long as they contain all common information types available across patients. Thereby expanding overall accuracy capabilities even though limited inputs may still result into reduced performance depending upon how similarity amongst dataset distributions was assessed originally; however, most notably resulting better accuracies than traditional non deep leanring-methods used previously within medical settings.. The goal here then becomes one where multiple levels must coalesce intelligently between low level features extracted by artificial intelligence algorithms such as those found inside convolution nets combined simultaneously along side physician expert knowledge gained throughout decades spent practicing on actual humans instead relying solely merely machines alone while ignoring what\u2019s provided via human experts experiences gathered up throughout years practicing medicine.. This way both sides will complement each others strengths providing maximum potential outcomes based on specific task objectives assigned respectively given set scenarios encountered day by day whether dealing standard operations involving healthy"

Sleep staging requires labeling long term EEG data into categories, which is time consuming and error prone. Recent works applying deep learning techniques have improved this process, but require training with large amounts (~10 hours) of expert labeled examples; these are expensive to obtain in practice. In addition most approaches use handcrafted features that do not directly capture interchangeable segments within the data or patterns associated between adjacent windows. We propose U-time a novel approach that allows faster training times and higher accuracy by leveraging an architecture similar to UNet for efficient segmentation on short 15 second sections. Using a small collection (2 hours), our proposed method provides competitive results relative to existing state of art methods on SleePEd database achieving a mean F1 score of $91.7\\%$ using only one second contextual information instead of 16 seconds needed by current alternatives. This work shows great potential toward real-world applications which can reduce sleep staging costs while improving reliability."

In this work we propose the application of multiphase level set functions into those CNN-based parsing methods and achieve promising results. This has also been applied in segmentation tasks such as brain tissue classification [14], or blood cell counts [6] . We first present some extensions to multigraph based representations of the scene graph structure proposed by Xia et al. [20] which allow us then to extend its network representation, the SPMVN , to deal with multiple classes. Then we describe our implementation modifications that make parsing feasible within a multiframe-level set framework, giving rise to MULSCENE (MUltiLabel ScENe). Our experiments not only clearly show the benefitsof using these techniques along with other improvements over stateof-the-art, but they also illustrate their practical use in parsing scenes for computer visiontasks [5, 8\u201311]."

An area in neural computation called neural registration has gained popularity due its ability to perform non-linear spatio functionally alignment between two or more images.

To provide realtivity clear application demonstrations illustrating the proposed solution's impact on medical imaging segmentaion , we apply our approach to segment lesions within brain scans which are then later mapped into 3D models suitable from analysis by computational chemists involved in develo pping novel therapies against diseases such as Alzhte rh s Disease ."

Our method leverages class similarities among categories, a semantic consistency assumption on how objects can be represented in two views with some minor differences when synthetically transferring labels in one view into segmentations in another. In order to leverage these relationships, we train our network using a combination of synthetic images that contain ground truth labels as well as real world images without such information through self supervision over generated semantic and pseudo depth predictions. Finally we propose an iterative refinement scheme (SyD-Refine) which further improves results. Extensive evaluation across various cross-view dataset pairs show state-of-the-art performance improvement over prior works on several metrics including Mean Average Precision and mean Intersection over Union under low label availability assumptions (e.g., 25% and 80%,). Furthermore, we analyze the error patterns for errors made by baseline methods and show that SynSeg-Net improves upon them consistently in all cases."

Specifically, we only use the semantic segmentation of the source image and the image-to-image translation of the target image. Our method consists of two stages.

      "generation": "We present an image translation method that improves semantic segmentation by adapting source maps to be more like target images, without requiring any labels in source-domain images or explicit guidance on what visual features should change. Our training loss encourages aligned regions to have similar colors -- especially those with strong color discontinuities (e.g., edges) between source and target maps. This goal may be accomplished as long as there exists some degree of structural alignment even if it\u2019s not perfect in all cases. As such we do not seek pixel-level correspondence using stereo matching.\n\nOur main contribution is introducing two regularization objectives used either directly or combined together through their effects on validation results as weighting terms for the overall supervised objective: 1) Edge consistency - penalizing different edge appearances across domains; and 2) Gradient flow alignment - encouraging gradients produced at high values (e.g., bright spots where objects stand out visually) to point towards corresponding points when they are mapped onto target images. These penalties discourage color inconsistencies as well as misleading gradient flows due precisely to mismatches along edges, respectively. In addition, the novelness of our work also lies within our approach which can perform joint color transfer and image synthesis within the GAN framework, improving its flexibility and applicability greatly."

In this work we formulate image segmentation as an optimization problem where data term consists of an energy function based on the Mumford-Shah loss functional. We show training set generalizes both region information and edge smoothness by learning the parameters controlling two terms: constant and quadratic data fidelity over edges and nonparametric piecewise constant level sets.

We propose to leverage this spatial and temporal structure by leveraging on spatio-temporally consistent appearance models that exploit motion over time. Our semantic image segmentation approach jointly integrates spatio-temporal and semantics models via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fully differentiable end-to-end optimization. Building on previous works, we further augment this unsupervised model to operate within limited supervision, yielding similar results when compared against state-of-the-art semi-supervised video segmentation methods using only \u224c17 labeled frames per class as opposed to up to 465 manually annotated frames used by competitors. Our method also produces competitive results even with single annotation frame and does not require any handmade modifications other than a standard class level loss function and a classification layer appended to a CNN that produces segmentation maps. In order to showcase the benefit our proposed learning based algorithm provides in both large-scale settings where fully supervisd training data are hard to come by without prior labels at low cost, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art systems. An evaluation on three publicly available datasets underlines the usefulness of taking advantage of short term dynamics for extracting relevant scene structures such as static background and foreground objects.\""

Due to its limited amount in medical scanning data, applying deep neural network (DNN) to learn a semantic representation that is accurate enough for segmentation could be challenging. To address this problem, we designed ACE-net, a framework containing augmented contracting and expansive paths. An auxiliary path expands a DNN gradually while other main DNN contracts it slowly until they reach similar feature dimensions, then predicts corresponding classification labels simultaneously. During the learning process, both are forced to converge to the same prediction results, thus a small training set can be sufficiently leveraged without losing much performance. Experiments on public datasets achieved state-of-the-art accuracy against existing works at competitive complexity. With 0-shot fine tuned models only trained on large scale imagery dataset e-shoppings, our method also achieved better performance than prior art significantly when applied to multiple downstream tasks."

Current deep learning approaches show impressive performance in object recognition, but fail at distinguishing objects in categories such as `airplane` or `tunnel`. To improve such fine-grained precision under long time difference, we propose two novel architectures: 1) an end-to-end joint training methodology that leverages RGB images, optical flow, depth maps and multi-tasked loss during network optimization; 2) novel CNN architecture design which consists of two different modules (e.g., LSTM, feature augmentation), working together on processing features of each image frame along timeline, thus yielding powerful network representation for robust object proposal detection. Our experiments prove the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies through quantitative analysis against prior works like SIFTFlow and C3D."

In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play multi-task module, Conv-MCD, to improve the performance of medical image segmentation. Conv-MCD is a lightweight module that can be easily integrated into any existing segmentation network. It consists of a convolutional layer and a multi-class discriminator (MCD). The convolutional layer is used to extract the features of the input image, and the MCD is used to classify the features into multiple classes. The MCD is trained in a multi-task learning manner, where it is jointly optimized with the segmentation network. The proposed Conv-MCD module can be used to improve the performance of medical image segmentation in two ways. First, it can be used to regularize the segmentation network by enforcing the features to be more discriminative. Second, it can be used to provide additional supervision signals for the segmentation network by training the MCD to predict the class labels of the input image. We evaluate the proposed Conv-MCD module on two medical image segmentation tasks: brain tumor segmentation and lung nodule segmentation.

      "generation": "Abstract Convolutional modules have been extensively explored in numerous computer vision tasks to enhance high level representations, e.G., by learning richer feature sets or exploiting hierarchical network architectures with strong discriminativelinkage between different layers. However, plugging such modules into existing medical image segmentation models remains challenging even in cases where they are shown to be effective. Firstly, due to large domain gaps in acquisition and semantics, simply transferring convolution modules derived from natural images directly to medicine is not effective as observed in similar works. Secondly, model interpretations on complex anatomies such as blood vessels and organs are hard to assess solely based on the input-output performance without human intervention. To address these problems, we propose Conv-MCD -- a plug-and-play multi-task module that consists of a cascade stacked structure built up with lightweight yet representative one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) convolutions which provide robust adaptive knowledge about multi-scale features from both low-level local and long-range interrelationships through skip connections while respecting the original feature channel sizes at each layer with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on three distinct domains of abdominal organ segmentation -- the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Extensive experimental findings demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods indicating the feasibility and effectiveness of applying 1D/2D pluggable conv-modules for enhancing model generalizability of multiscale contextual information across a wide range of modalities including CT and MRI."

In contrast, we develop a generic neural architecture that can be adapted efficiently across any number of diverse recognition problems.

Besides, manually labeling some specific regions can be extremely difficult as they often require extensive knowledge such as rare scenes or fine details, which results in noise data points (e.g., false labels) due to human mistake or misleading situations like missing annotations. In many cases where labels do not exist while images does, especially those collected freely from internet, we cannot build a model through machine or crowd labeled approaches because humans would make too easily mistakes as their intention is only to provide coarseness of each pixel even when trying to focus on important objects. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art image segmentations mainly deals with accurate labels, so there exist issues in practical usability without considering noisiness, meaning our daily life environment images are less than perfect input to generalized models. This work proposes a supervised algorithm specifically designed for noisy label cases for improving model robustness on unseen environments by collecting training data more efficiently and also minimizing errors during training processes. In order to solve these problems at once, we introduce new loss functions in PoseNet architecture by applying weight maps learned dynamically based on multiple features extracted from various intermediate layers, thereby preventing accumulating noises across layers leading to unexpected gradient propagation directions. Since most noicelessly dataset is quite cost in recent era, our approach could be suitable for most image classification or other computer vision areas, while still keeping low labored works for building reliable semantic image mapping networks against any distribution change via dynamic selection strategy."

This solution relies on state-of-the art computer vision methods previously applied mainly to digital elevation models and depth maps; nevertheless our approach exploits GSV wide angle cameras to derive not only height but also horizontal disparity information required for stereo matching algorithms that are commonly employed for 3D reconstruction purposes. To achieve these goals firstly we apply an adapted version of multiplicative morphological filtering specifically designed to improve disparity map generation results (Fig. 1). Once sufficient accuracy has been achieved upon input RGB pairs of image sequences we follow with semi-automatic selection of both epipolar lines boundaries, necessary steps towards a successful application of the method developed by Sturm et al.[4] for calculating the so called \u201cmean plane\u201d in the vertical direction followed by a novel iterative subdivision process that seeks to minimize horizontal disparities between pixels assigned to adjacent segments after dividing each individual mean plane according to criteria set by user specified thresholds. While the former might seem analogous of what happens during typical edge detection tasks occurring in most computer vision problems (i.e., separating boundaries along certain regions present or absent), here instead its use lies exclusively within obtaining optimal disparity mappings based off reliable assumptions made upon geometric transformations involved throughout every"

      "generation": "- Modern deep learning techniques have been shown to outperform traditional segmentation algorithms in most tasks, and this can be attributed mainly to their ability to capture more complex features in segmenting an image than traditional methods which rely on predefined feature sets, rules or heuristics. Hence there has been increased interest over recent years by researchers into devising new deep network architectures with the aim of improving classification accuracy . Most existing works [1],[2] are typically focused on proposing improved classification networks via enhanced architecture design such as using convolutional neural networks (CNN), cascading multi layer neural networks etc., with a limited attempt at making any comparison against other classifiers that make use of classical image segmentation approaches like wavelet methods, random forest or Bayesian Markov logic. In our study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation between traditional machine learning classification methods and proposed deep CNN based ones, including several popular topologies such as AlexNet , VGG -NET, OverFeat etc, through experimental simulation on the ICDAR 2007 dataset. Our results indicate that the best performing model in most cases were achieved by employing state of art deep CNNs; albeit not always and often times classical machine learning techniques managed to beat them particularly when it came to evaluating the effectiveness of image representation during segmentation i.e., using wavelets vs filters etc. Therefore we argue that further investigation should shift away from simply trying to redesign better NN structures without regard for their applicability, but rather focus more upon how these models interact within different data environments/representations with varying degrees of success depending on task requirements so information transfer between layers could be optimized"

Following by construction processes of the target structured models on respective domains (i.e., colour graphs, HSV histogram hypergraphs with their corresponding hyperedges), we designed statistical approaches based on either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian methods over those modeled structures, such that the proposed statistical approaches are able to segment images automatically from given regions defined a priori while simultaneously obtaining better information regarding the relationship between foreground region and background regions.

Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNN) have generated impressive results, but their application as image processing tools has been mainly limited by two factors: i) DNNs are large and expensive models that require high computational power at test time ii) they generally use pre-trained models obtained over vast datasets with no task nor domain specificities whereas they perform poorly on small and weakly labelled subfields datasets. We present a real life case-study by implementing a fully convolutional network for retinopathy screen diagnosis directly on patch level annotations thus circumventing problem i). We show how this approach can overcome both of the challenges listed above: not only does our segmentation model converge faster than standard classifiers trained on pixelwise labelling, but it also performs comparably well while requiring fewer training examples.\n\nFull Text PDF 8 Page(s): http://arxive.csail.mit.edu/papers/0319452011b735e5a7f6cddabcdccdbf3deacdd8b194a6cb124cce5aeaf9ac08ad34ba54ca66ea84fe8daaaef.pdf"

We explore using inter-annotator agreement among human annotations as one possible way out in this scenario. After selecting two types of problems where we expect disagreement may be beneficial- tumor margin prediction for breast cancer staging, and lesion segmentation for skin image analysis - through a small amount of qualitative investigation of existing clinical guidelines and some online discussions with clinicians, we evaluate several ways of determining thresholds below which agreement should not be trusted before moving forward. While results vary somewhat depending on the application, our analysis shows preliminary evidence that taking into account overall uncertainty due to variability across annotators can alleviate some errors generated by individual systems without sacrificing too much useful precision."

Firstly, it leverages a multiplier approach towards the traditional softmax loss computation procedure by allowing each class to be assigned distinct coefficients based upon its importance, resulting into more precise perceptive loss calculations. Secondly, for the boundary detection step, we propose a new end-to-end learnable convolutional network module namely \u201cThe Constrained Multi-Scale Conditional Neuron Module\u201d(CMNCM) which combines various well established state of art architecture such as Attention Gated Fully Connected Networks (AFCN) to enhance the accuracy level under varying imaging conditions. Finally, for boosting training time and further refining the results obtained from CMNMs, we have experimented with Self training data augmentation steps like flipping, brightness variation, saturation variation and zooming for generating a hybrid labeled dataset containing images of varied resolution for improved model performance as well as less complex structure detection issues present at object boundaries in RS imagery. All these components help us identify more fine grained details within objects thus improving overall classification rate of different pixels belonging to landuse classes along their interfaces in the final output representation leading to better understanding of the underlying imaging process than existing methods like PSP net [5], FC Nets[6] or DenseNet [4].\n> Furthermore, for the experimental evaluation, we used four datasets including two global and region specific benchmark datasets called Quickbird AACI Challenge Dataset, Airbus IGS Aerial Image Landcover Classification Dataset (the first ever dataset with high spatial and large scale resolution i.e, 0.96m) from international geoscience symposium challenges and two publically available urban regions focused datasets called University of Salzburg building extraction challenge (UNISA) dataset and ETH Zurich"

We begin by discussing the importance of diversity in ML and the challenges that arise when ML models are not diverse. We then present a framework for promoting diversity in ML, which includes a set of principles and guidelines for designing and evaluating ML models. Finally, we discuss the implications of our framework and provide recommendations for future research.\n\nThe paper is available here."

      "generation": "> The ability of machine learning systems to learn and generalize has advanced dramatically over the past five years, especially with advances that use deep neural networks such as vision recognition and image classification. However, despite this remarkable progress on the machine-learning side, these new techniques have not proven robust at scale outside controlled test cases. Consequently, one could argue we are building the ultimate biased classifiers without any safeguards or guarantees about the quality of their results beyond their success during testing (either by the original authors or after having been released publicly). In this paper I argue there exist multiple sources of error including incorrect models and data issues but also bias associated to both development practices and human interpretation. Specifically, while large amounts of open source code help reduce most errors originating directly from developers\u2019 code writing skills, it aggravates potential systematic developer-bias towards certain types of applications. It appears this diversity issue can now be amplified tenfold thanks to today\u2019s AI/ML popularity when compared to the nineties where such systems were considered by most businesses too costly / risky to invest time and money into R&D (and therefore rarely deployed due to potential system failure). As a matter of fact since 98% of the code written worldwide every year consists in maintainance projects or direct extensions of legacy ones which are neither subjected nor designed to work fully correctly nor do they follow modern best development practices, all the same mistakes could happen again even more rapidly than ever before if no countermeasures aren't promptly taken right away !\n\nPeter Thiel recently claimed he agrees with everything in this post, going so far as to refer to this situation as creating an \u201cautomated lynch mob\u201d."

In this work, we address two problems that arise when applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image segmentation tasks: 1) learning robust features for all classes despite having only one fully labeled set of images per class; 2) incorporating temporal information to improve classification accuracy while not sacrificing spatial resolution in feature maps and/or computational cost and time complexity during training and testing. We use CNN-based architectures along with long short term memory models to tackle both issues by extending our previous architecture (Liu & Yao, 2015). First, rather than using the usual approach which makes multiple passes through images before making final predictions,we build upon prior work that uses a single pass prediction scheme for sequence segmentation combined with conditional random fields(CRFs), a popular postprocessing technique used after a series decision boundaries have been trained based on input patterns. Secondly, unlike traditional fully connected CRFswhich suffer from high dimensionality due to having thousands of nodes representing each word or character in vocabulary sets, ours utilizes recurrent convolutions(Matthews et al., 2018and Xing et al., 2019 ) within its hidden states allowing for significantly fewer parameters while maintaining similar performance levels"

We compare our method on 59 CTMRI patients from two public datasets against state-of-the - art methods showing that our approach improves the accuracy and reduces run time compared to other methods available on publically reproducible code bases, while still respecting all relevant metrics needed when working with real medical data; i.e. producing biased but usable results if training / testing sets differ substantially in population distribution, e.g. race/gender/age etc. Additionally we also include a comparison study which shows how our algorithm performs comparably well as much higher dimensional approaches on limited and sparse image types such as cines or short stacks of ECG\u2010triggered images. We conclude that by extending the scope of these networks to generalize over larger spatial scales within a frame (i.e., taking into account information from prior frames), more robust models can be achieved, particularly for challenging clinical applications where variability in patient position and breathing motion affects cardiac structure detection.

By formulating semantic image segmentation as sequential decision making process, our method learns how to hierarchically integrate features across scales without relying upon manually specified module combinations or hard-coded network patterns (e.g., dilated convolution and atrous spatial pyramid pooling). We devise an effective reward function that evaluates the predicted pixel labels on the fly while maximizing its expected value by optimizing candidate actions selected step by step and backpropagating gradients through the policy. Furthermore, we employ a novel search space where each level maintains a distinct module set which enables localized interactions among modules with varying scope in all dimensions including channels, kernel size, dilation rate and downsampling ratio. In consequence, our model searches beyond simply stacking feature maps into deeper layers but instead finds powerful nonlinear combinations tailored towards semantics. On PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, Auto-DeepLab outperforms previous state-of-the-art architecture designs (e.g., atrous spatial pyramid pooling) and the recently proposed fully trainable networks based on cascaded recurrent convolutional cells by achieving 78.4% mIoU. Finally, visualizations of learned models confirm their competence over existing architectures."

      "generation": "- Abstract : In this article, we introduce an algorithm which generates visual images (3D rendered cars) of vehicle using surrounding views by inputting one or more 2D/3D point clouds and their spatial ranges. Also, in order to improve the efficiency of rendering image, we propose another method that does not use multiple camera models but uses only two camera points. By changing the position and orientations of cameras using two rotation axes that have different tilt angle relative to object and each other, various kinds of vehicles can be generated without lossing quality. And our proposed approach does not need any information about 3D CAD data such as geometry or design parameters of individual components of target vehicle. Using GPU hardware acceleration technology improves performance up to 10 times compared to CPU processing alone in real time application."

      "generation": "> Medical image segmentation is challenging since it involves extracting specific information (eg, tissue type) within complex 3D images having high contrast and poor resolution due to noise, artifacts etc. In some cases, abnormalities in structure or function might not be visible as standard images usually provide only cross sectional data while the actual shape of an organ can only be determined by viewing different parts at various angles. Here we demonstrate that in such scenarios, dynamic imaging can be used to visualize structural changes that are not immediately evident. In our work, brain tumor perfusions were imaged over a time-series using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which provided valuable insights during clinical examination; specifically, where the tumor was located relative to other healthy brain tissues surrounding them, their size/extent of growth, how many tumors existed per patient ect. We further implemented an unsupervised filter based method to segment dynamic MRI scans into one healthy, and multiple diseased regions. Using this approach we demonstrated reliable partitioning of voxels for patients who have multiple glioblastomas present as well as those with larger sized ones comparedto single smaller sized one in presence of heterogeneity due to different lesion densities. Our filter also outperformed commonly used supervised machine learning approaches which had difficulty in separating closely spaced lesions that lack clear distinctions between each other (e.g., very similar sizes). This technique could therefore improve early diagnosis & detection by providing more accurate & automated medical guidance tools in future, leading toward improved quality healthcare outcomes especially within resource constrained settings with limited accessibility to trained specialists worldwide!"

Previous techniques do not consider all structures jointly since doing so makes development quite challenging due to different data complexity, signal quality, noise level, number of possible surfaces, shape irregularities, size variation across populations, etc., among others. Our approach considers simultaneously nine interrelated surface structures (i.e., femur medial condyle, tibia medial plateau, femur lateral condyle, patellar cartilage, cruciate ligaments, collateral ligaments, quadriceps tendon, and medial meniscus) with the capability of considering multiple instances per subject, thereby enabling multiplanar analyses via 2-dimensional slicing. We employ a learning based framework by automatically finding an optimal cost metric (combination of spatial distance measure, geometric regularizer, statistical appearance measure and shape prior) using synthetic and patient data that are acquired both at rest and during motion acquisition. Experimental results demonstrate accurate, robust, automated segmentation on 10 real subjects."

In some imaging modalities, such as CT-angiography with coronary opacification (CTCA), reliable annotations are not readily available. Recently supervised approaches that use convolutional neural networks have increased accuracy compared to classical methods but their extraction of local information does not rely on any biologically motivated assumptions about image formation, which is crucial when using complex images. We propose incorporating both physics based models of global structure priors by means of level set evolution and probabilistic models of local data variations into a hybrid network architecture capable of capturing multi-level features for segmentation purposes while being robust against noise, high contrast areas, and partial volume, three common issues during MR and CT myocardial imaging. This novel approach allows our method to simultaneously incorporate physiological and pathophysiological knowledge acquired by clinicians via intensity profile comparisons between healthy individuals and patients with impaired myocardium function or degradation induced by age or treatment. Our architecture consists of fully connected layers followed by several repetitions of residual blocks containing 3D dilated convolutions, max pooling/upsampling operations and convolution operators performing mixtures-of-Bernoulli density estimation in order to extract shape-specific statistical descriptions of intensity patterns present in each 3D volume slice.\n> Authors' Note: Preprint\n\nThis work was submitted by Vahid Ghanavati via this Quasar Science article submission form."

An initial densly network without bottlenecks but also without connections between features at different scales was proposed in Ref [20]. Deng et al introduce several new blocks such as block-attention module, atrous feature pyramid attention subnet which were mainly designed to adapt it to segmentation tasks. On small datasets they outperform previous networks like unet, refine net or link net(also referred on C38) and report similar results to some other approaches from Ref 4,5 and even better performance results. We do further experiments using only ResNet-101 and we try various ways combining its shortcut connection, pooling layer and our novel block and obtain very fast converging models that compare favourably against state of the art. Our approach reduces the number of layers significantly compared to earlier attempts yet achieves competitive performance, reducing run time significantly. It might be one of most compact approaches among all CNNs having achieved comparable scores to the top networks so far. Also note unlike U-NET and others where skip links are present at specific location within deeper and shallower paths in current literature only few works explore incorporating them directly across all levels, i.e., in this work we use multiple downsampling factors at early stages followed by up sampling operations during test phase giving higher resolution predictions (involving less errors e.g see Fig4), instead just using few lateral connections or adding more convolutional filters inside each level after maxpool ops but removing those links afterwards leading mostly to poorer results when tested over standard benchmarks (see Table1-5). In conclusion our method has been shown capable enough for challenging problems without introducing too much complexity while improving overall model capacity through simple modifications allowing us easily modify existing implementations resulting faster training times than alternative schemes plus enabling faster tests during post processing routines since information gets passed back efficiently without requiring complex nonlinear activation functions which can cause problems due reduced generalization error rate being observed.."

Our approach is inspired by the observation that the visual complexity of a scene is often dominated by a small number of semantically meaningful objects. We therefore propose to first detect and segment these objects, and then to simplify the scene by removing all other objects. This simplification step is performed by a novel semantic simplification network that is trained to predict the visibility of each object in the scene. The network is trained in a supervised manner using a large-scale dataset of 3D scenes. We show that our approach is able to significantly reduce the visual complexity of a scene, while preserving the most important objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of dense 3D visual mapping, where we show that our approach is able to generate more accurate and detailed maps than state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe paper is available here."

Specifically, we propose an efficient framework to solve an inverse problem - given images collected by microscopy (both electron and fluorescence) find accurate segmentation of the cells they contain. This is challenging due to difficulties in acquiring labeled datasets with enough data diversity. To cope with this issue, we have proposed two techniques based on weakly supervised learning. First, instead of building networks using a single pretrained dataset at once and later fine tuning them individually we built a series pipeline where one network learns from another (starting with only 2-3 labeled training samples). Second, for a dataset containing different views of each cell (which might not match well), we train our deep architecture to predict corresponding locations across multiple modalities by simultaneously mining the relations between them, without any explicit ground truth correspondence available (\"Metric Learning\"). Our approach works remarkably well on unseen test data compared to standard methods while enabling real-time prediction (5 frames/second per cell on 4K pixel resolution images or >160k voxels). With this work, we want to emphasize that deep learning approaches should be preferred whenever possible over traditional ones since they tend to automatically benefit all future stages even when trained for a particular setup."

Although our proposed architecture uses only a shallow three layers convolutional encoding (no batch normalization or any other heavy regularization), without complex post processing our model reaches state-of-the art performance even on large test set such as OASIS where training labels are not available at all (on 10 subjects). Methods Our system extends an off-the-shelf deep neural net with a new loss term which enforces both pixel-based reconstructions of image-to-mask correspondences and learned latent space representations to lie close to each others - we demonstrate effectiveness of this approach via comparative experiments done over several datasets including OASIS which lacks ground truth manual labelling completely. Important features like those of knee-shapes, spine bends, head, eye socket etc., can be captured automatically by simple low dimensional representation. Results Accuracy and speed evaluation demonstrates that JointShapeNet outperforms alternative approaches based either on learning latent representation separately without accounting for known correspondence information in it, or applying CNNs directly to regression of dense predictions."

We train this network to extract dense superpixel features and predict a label for each feature based on a predefined segmentation task (e.g., organ delineation), which are then combined into a semantic segmentation map by stitching individual predictions together via boundary refinement. To compensate for variations between image modalities and anatomies, we propose multi-scale losses in which segmentations trained on one modality can be quickly applied as priors towards training another task. For instance, chest CT lung segmentations help train liver segmentations just two days later using only liver data; no manual segmentations or additional parameters were used for this transfer. This method eliminates the need to learn new networks per dataset and/or problem domain while improving robustness in unseen testing scenarios such as scans at different resolutions or orientations. We show that this cascade decoder framework produces accurate and high resolution results that generalize well across various organs (liver, kidneys, pancreas, prostate and brain hippocampus)."

Among several commonly used techniques, deep learning (DL), which allows us to easily design effective image segmentation models that can make use of complex semantic information about images even when we do not necessarily know how it works behind its scene thanks to DL\u2019s black box mechanism, seems to serve well as one of the most suitable choices owing to various features including relatively high accuracy rates and computational efficiency on modern computing platforms. Unfortunately, however, if there comes an extremely difficult problem that existing pretrained models cannot cope with, then we are only left with manually designing the models ourselves. This study proposes a method for iris localization using a simple structure but flexible hyperparameters, which makes it possible to extract desired regions by automatically retraining well-known off-the-shell DL model(s). To demonstrate its effectiveness quantitatively, a comparative test was conducted with 129 real-life iris images under both regular lighting condition and extreme low intensity illumination environments."

Specifically, the proposed convolution performs holistic and symmetric decomposition on input voxel through convolutional filtering by a novel design inspired by bilinear pooling and bilateral upsampling methods, allowing for effective extraction of global context and preservation of local geometry at each layer of network, thus achieving more accurate segmentation with fewer parameters than previous work. We first verify that this technique enhances the semantic embedding capabilities of network components across various networks. Subsequently, to ensure scalability and compatibility with current popular CNN architectures, we extend our approach into an adaptable format termed D(e)conv (i.e., deformation + convolution), so named because it is compatible with different combinations of fully or partially-deformable backbones, such as UNet-like encoders/decoders or Skip Connections with skipping layers removed prior to applying spatial attention module. Experiments conducted on the recently released SSCaer dataset demonstrate significant improvement over baseline approaches. Furthermore, given sparse training data, D(e)Convin achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing fully-supervised regression/classification models, and also shows high robustness when trained with only few annotated slices per volume, indicating its potential utility in semi-/un-labeled scenarios."

To avoid the costly evaluation of the RFFs we introduce the Kronecker product approach of applying generalized Laplace transform which yields analytical expressions for matrix-vector multiplications and reduces evaluation time by several orders of magnitude. Applying these to the graph Laplacian operator of fully connected networks allows scaling up numerical calculations over huge datasets and also facilitates their parallelization. We show that, contrary our previous findings where RFF was compared against conventional polynomial NFFT interpolation only when implemented in one dimension exclusively, both options turn out almost equivalent even when evaluated over high dimensional data samples simultaneously through standard fast Fourier transforms."

[JMIV'18]). Those models are now able to compete against experts by achieving very high accuracy scores and even outperform them when they oversegment or undesegmentate cases due to their fatigue or lack of experience. However, those approaches are still unable to deal properly with uncommon pathologies like infant brain diseases that may require subjective knowledge before being correctly classified/detected if there was enough training data available; but unfortunately this is not typically (yet) usually the case in most pathologies for some well known reasons such as limited accessibility to the patient database needed with the corresponding ground truth labelled images, etc. Therefore the purpose and objective of this work is showcasing how recent deep learning architectures can achieve both state-of-the-art precision results while simultaneously allowing us to evaluate any prediction outcome as truly exclusive and independent so helping thus researchers make sense of what to expect after being trained on noisy data without proper supervision; i.e., the expected false negative rates will never go beyond the upper confidence bound we set forth herein."

These two sets of information can be used to inform patients on prognosis while also evaluating novel treatment alternatives. Methodology As machine learning models cannot interpret volumetric data automatically, we need to provide image patches along with a binary mask indicating what belongs or not to the desired feature. To produce the binary masks, it was necessary firstly extracting and defining region of interests around specific brain areas containing one or more tumor types per slice, then performing manual brush tool in 3d Slicer to obtain high quality brain volume/tissue borders that are critical for our deep neural network training process. Afterwards, we fed these masks to three ensemble 3D U-net networks pretrained with publically available datasets of brain MRIs in two categories: low grade glioma (LGG) and Glioblastoma, multiforme (GBM), aiming at classifying pixels as healthy or anomalous ones. Next step involved applying image registration between every subject\u2019s images and publicly available standard template in Freesurfer's FIRST Atlas. This provides us with landmarks for brain tissues segments classification. Results Deep learning architectures achieved promising results concerning accuracy, sensitivity and precision for LGG (0.945, 78% and 99%) and for GBM (0.672, 50%, and 85.4%) when trained with 10 subjects only and tested against unseen subjects. Conclusion By means of the proposed methodological approach it would be possible to better understand the evolution of cerebral neoplasms in patients so that it will be possible to treat them before they reach higher stages of malignancy -thus reducing expenses and preventing further harm due to disease progression. Besides being able to detect which parts of the brain have been affected may help doctors"

Our cluster cues can be used to drive segmentations or trackers by providing them with spatio-temporal hints derived from spatial layout information which is readily extracted from video clips without any need for additional training or tuning per image / video frame for the cluster estimation method employed. Furthermore, we show this approach can also be useful on images for single-shot segmentation, especially when only small amounts of training data specific to the target application domain is available.\""

Our novel solutions achieved better reconstruction results than conventional methods on both MRI and Nuclear Medicine datasets, respectively. We present our implementation details hereof along with extensive experimental analyses of its performance in registering arbitrary dense volumes while addressing non-linear transformation challenges. Firstly, we design two optimization algorithms that minimize the intensity difference between the source volume Fsource and target Ftarget based on mutual information and correlation ratio as data fidelity measures. Secondly, as an iterative scheme, each algorithm alternates minimizing the distance function Ls in terms of moving points at a current position xi and searching best corresponding destination yj during every iteration step: PminLsdxi-yj=PdFx-Fy+cLp(x)-rLq. In this study, we have used fast graph cuts based algorithms to obtain a fast exact minimum path by converting each point within volume grids into graph nodes and then setting up connecting costs that are determined according to Euclidean or Haussdorf distances with respect to moving points\u2019 positions. Results confirm high quality of registered output volumes alongwith low required computing power by proposed method where registration is done smoothly through time and in realtime applications.\n\nThe following illustrative figure shows part of the paper's graphical representation:\n\nThe following diagram represents some additional references cited in the abstract's body text:\nhttps://vacantrakar.github.io/images/references.png"

      "generation": "Image segmentation, which aims to separate an object or image region of interest from its immediate environment through partitioning it into pixels/voxels with similar intensities and semantic information, is a foundational computer vision task in both medical imaging as well as robotics. Its relevance has increased due to recent advances of deep learning models that learn visual representations by training large-sized datasets with massive annotations that are typically scarce. For example, automatic delineation using such generative methods can significantly assist radiologists, who have traditionally carried out the tedious manual analysis of MR and CT scans for diagnostic purposes. Unfortunately, despite their ability to perform classification tasks accurately within closed data environments (which often lack sufficient diversity), standard model types suffer performance drops when confronted with unseen distribution shifts at scale since they capture domain invariant patterns rather than classifiers tailor-made to real input images with varied illumination conditions and pixel values not seen during training. Here we demonstrate a domain adaptation framework consisting of CycleGANs coupled with multi-task adversarial training and feature perturbations that automatically adapts existing CNN architectures across common MRI contrasts without additional supervision. Through empirical evaluation on several medical image classes, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance while remaining transparent about the type of domain bias being mitigated."

      "generation": "Abstract: Effective cloud detection has long been recognized as one of the critical issues in satellite data processing because clouds are significant error sources affecting the quantitative accuracy of many applications such as precipitation monitoring. Recently, most studies on automatic estimation of surface rainfall over an area have begun focusing mainly on developing accurate algorithms or techniques for producing precise ground parameters (e.g. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks [PERSIANN]; Multi-level Parameterization Method [MPM]). Although the development of rainfall parameter estimating techniques has advanced considerably during the past decade [Practical Oblique Radiance Analysis and Synthesis System [PROBAAS]], there remain some open questions regarding this issue that callfor further investigation. Based on literature review, we find out two specific limitations concerning existing techniques when used alone as wellas a hybrid method to estimate ground parameters by applying several methods together with different approaches to solve these problems. First, although it can produce more realistic results than other schemes, Perri- ann based on artificial neural network algorithm (Per- siann-cn) fails to provide stable performance especially in a region covered completelyby clouds. Second, since no reliable information about high elevated clouds is available even with 24 hour visibility, MPM cannot distinguish between low elevated cumulus and high cirrus clouds. Both limitations were alleviated via adopting a gradient enhancement technique to refine the output of conventional image enhancement systems combinedwith multiple level sensor fusion which enabled us to consider both low/middle clouds captured by VIIRS instruments on board polar or geostationary satellites while avoiding contamination caused by visible channels on GOES instrument onboard meteorological (Meteo\u2019 geostationary orbiting environmental satellites)."

Specifically, if some parts of image pixels have higher variations than other parts at the same resolution levels and some regions contain much more points/pixels while others include very small amounts of them, many existing algorithms would generate mispredictions near the boundaries on these highly varying regions when being applied directly.

Several researchers in this area have put forth many algorithms which utilize prior domain knowledge over existing graph cuts schemes. However, these methods are unable to extract the actual information about object boundaries based on pixel-wise region specifications or probability distributions. Thus we propose an objective function that minimizes a global energy that can be computed efficiently by alternatively finding minimum cut through graph cut and then doing updates using Beltrami operator thereby reducing time complexity at each iteration drastically with better local minima convergence when compared to other approaches in literature. We present several results illustrating significant improvement to various aspects like computational effort as well as robustness against noise over traditional formulations showing the effectiveness of our proposed scheme"

We also propose a new evaluation metric, the average intersection over union (AIOU), to evaluate the performance of VOS algorithms. We conduct extensive experiments on YouTube-VOS and show that our dataset is challenging and can be used to evaluate the performance of VOS algorithms. We hope that YouTube-VOS will become a standard benchmark for VOS and help to advance the state-of-the-art in this field.\n\nThe paper is available here."

      "generation": "Abstract: In many fields (e.g., medical imaging, materials science and biology) microscope images capture important features relevant to human life such as biological events or physical measurements; however they are often difficult to process since these processes require substantial computational resources. While current methods can perform high quality denoising, deblurring and segmentation on individual images with good precision for simple objects; but when considering complex structures this becomes increasingly harder due to large variance across examples/images. Recent developments attempt to address these challenges via data augmentation - a way of transforming inputs through parameter selection so there's less bias towards specific samples while still maintaining similarities amongst them enough such that results remain consistent when applied upon all test cases equally well \u2013 leading us closer toward more generalization capabilities within Machine Learning models themselves which should improve overall accuracy scores even further down line ultimately yielding better quality outputs over time! We introduce a new model called SegNet, built atop our previous work which showed great success on medical image analysis tasks like detecting breast cancer using only small amounts of labeled input(<15 annotated slices). One significant difference between existing approaches towards nuclear recognition in histopathology is that we incorporate a segmentation algorithm capable not just classifying each cell individually into its respective category (say tumorous vs non-tumour), but also determining their location relative others around it thus enabling more accurate diagnosis outcomes based off contextual information available . Another breakthrough made possible during our experiments involving automatic nucleus detection included adapting network architectures already proven successful witin classification environments hence showing how transfer learning techniques play vital role shaping next generation machine vision systems needed today\u2019s world.."

      "generation": "Recent progress on segmenting image data has been driven by learning from semantically labelled pixels and annotated mask maps, which require expert labour to label or curate objects across many images (e.g., via pixelwise object detection). In this paper, we ask whether we can leverage pretrained large language models such as GPT-3 to construct a much richer, cheaper source dataset in order to learn to reason about segmentation masks. This question opens up new possibilities because these neural architectures already contain immense amounts of knowledge learned during training over huge corpora of documents. Instead of learning only what to predict within a single visual field using a grounded embedding like CLIP (or other recent methods that similarly require inputting multiple queries), we hypothesize that an ideal model would take into account all background information it knows when inferring mask predictions. We develop novel tasks involving querying large vision\u2013language models such as LLaMA1and InstructGPT2 to produce a set of high-confidence, unambiguous concepts regarding any target region with no need for explicit supervision at scale. From these outputs, we define and collect our own high quality, domain agnostic, human-labelled large natural scene datasets. With these datasets, we discover that state-of-theart fine-tuning approaches using standard datasets and augmentations benefit greatly from additionally incorporating concept data. Although some previous work has demonstrated positive results leveraging existing knowledge distillation techniques, our approach enables performance gains significantly larger than the correspondingly reduced computational cost. Our analysis also reveals complementarities among concepts compared to both individual labels, and how incorporating related concepts benefits downstream accuracy even further by reducing noise and handling ambiguity more effectively than simply averaging them together, especially in challenging situations where there may be significant perceptual variation between images but semantic meaning remains consistent.\""

Moreover, our method does not utilize data augmentations schemes or multi-modal imagery because it can automatically learn these features during training by applying convolutional neural network ensembles with transfer learning techniques while also incorporating CRF smoothing algorithms to account for potential discontinuities in the boundaries between organs/anatomical structures. Experimental results show that the proposed system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance by using both single models trained on public datasets while generating similar high accuracies when adopting other approaches like ensemble voting/averaged models after bootstrapping across numerous training iterations per organ of interest (organ specific).

Our approach combines information from multiple resolution levels within one unified CNN framework which increases its robustness compared to existing methods when operating under challenging conditions such as illumination variation, eyelid artefacts and occlusion during mortem imaging. Moreover the use of CNNs permits fully automatic prediction with no need for additional training even though our input data comes from several different sources (intra vs inter ocular) thereby eliminating the dependency on high quality ground truth. Finally, because it can be run offline, after capture, it enables efficient workload management by reducing bandwidth constraints caused by remote biometric identification requests. A public database including 2654 post-mortem iris pictures will also accompany our manuscript making an important contribution to advancing the state of the art both theoretically and application wise.\n\nAnd here's the description provided at arXaiv.com:\n\n> This project explores novel applications of machine intelligence technologies for critical security operations. It focuses specifically on how artificial neural networks may be applied to automate the tasks required for biometrics authentication within the context of national defense programs. An early success was achieved through the creation of a tool that improves biometrics capabilities without compromising privacy. The system uses computer vision techniques on photos taken in a controlled environment where individuals submit their irises via camera phone. Deep learning provides accurate matching outcomes that match an incoming image against a large existing photo repositories. Additionally, the technology has identified a practical method for securing sensitive identity records and personal information stored in memory and database centers used by government agencies."

To achieve this goal we design an algorithm implementing non-convex primal-dual stochastic methods with implicit L2 and LInfty gradient penalty terms. More concretely we propose a novel formulation for using the popular label smoothing (LS) regularizer (Szegedy et al., 2016), which instead of adding noise uniformly over all classes reduces class probability according to its position ranking on predictive probabilities at test time. While previous work has viewed these mechanisms primarily as ways to improve computational stability of neural nets during early stages of training, we instead present them as a powerful tool for controlling smoothness properties and promoting good solution quality under more challenging conditions such as model extrapolation. For our experiments, we choose several difficult problems including CIFAR-10,CIFAR -100, SVHN, ImageNet and GTSRB where L2/LInfty regularizers are shown empirically to be very effective approaches towards solving the problem."

In addition, our method can deal with myocardium segmentation even if there are poor image quality. To achieve these goals, our proposed approach integrated two automated segmentation steps: (i) first a shape model based on level-sets optimization is estimated using random forest classifier which does not need any domain information; (ii) then an efficient contour refinement is performed as an iterative procedure that incorporates morphological shape analysis along with spatial statistics guided by learned features of myocardium and background regions.

Based on visual attention we propose an end-to-end predictor architecture using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that evaluates visualizations of semantic segmentation quality in images via 100 percent accurate CNN's predictions about two image attributes known during model training time (i.e., whether there is a foreground object inside the prediction window). Attention model generates score maps representing importance at each pixel and based on these attention regions the original input image is transformed into a new intermediate representation. This transformer is able to produce output whose structure matches input image and thereby enable effective evaluation of different areas using a single scalar quantity derived through deep learning process rather than handcrafted approach."

Our approach overcomes some constraints faced by previous methods including the need for high resolution input images and reliance on handcrafted feature extraction, while also simplifying training using single stage models without intermediate supervision levels. We tested it on six datasets: DUT-Om and MSRA, covering scenes containing multiple objects; Cityscapes dataset (20% train/val split); Salient Objects dataset and COCO Panoptic Segmentations dataset focusing exclusively on saliency or foreground detection challenges respectively; and Videospace dataset targeting videos. Evaluation shows performance similar if not better than current state-of-the art methods while running much faster since our network can be 60% smaller due to simpler pipeline architecture. Additionally, we evaluate performance when varying number of clusters learned during model training enabling quantification of impact caused by under fitting or overfitting of small datasets commonly found across application domains lacking large volumes of labeled data available today for deep learning."

Classifier predictions on individual voxels are propagated through dense graph structures defined by spatial adjacency or higher-order neighborhood relationships between neighboring voxels to obtain labels to which segments at various levels of granularity correspond respectively; localization and global surface coherence can be enforced if such graph structures impose meaningful constraints upon labels they contain via label propagation procedures. To make training viable in high dimension and to encourage consistency between predictions made at different depths within SFCN stacks while encouraging label refinement as information about surrounding context becomes available, the proposed framework leverages shared weighting for all layers. By demonstrating results and ablation studies across multiple datasets of medical images as well as a challenging point cloud dataset from object recognition literature, we prove that deep learning enables promising performance even when facing tasks not originally intended as targets during network training. In addition, our approach naturally extends beyond binary segmentations into multi-label cases and achieves state-of-the-art multi-tissue segmentation over BrainWeb MRI simulated scans, outperforming previous methods without the need for extra preprocessing steps required therein nor any use of any other datasets, despite being trained exclusively on one particular domain of data which does not have equivalent ground truth labels provided; this generalizability may also explain why our algorithm delivers strong performance without modification on a point cloud segmentation task whose input modality differs radically from the volumetric ones typically preferred in machine learning applications."

      "generation": "> State-of-the-art deep learning architectures are able to accurately segment a wide variety of 3D anatomical structures when provided with large, manually labeled training datasets; unfortunately, in most cases such data simply do not exist. Moreover, fully convolutional neural networks require significantly more labels than traditional hierarchically structured models like Random Forests. To address these difficulties, we present AtU-net, a new model that utilizes local attention mechanisms within the encoder and decoder to learn both global object representations (where the organ typically resides) as well as detailed contextual information on each voxel about why it was included or excluded from the prediction at test time. We propose using an energy formulation for calculating per-voxel scores that automatically includes prior knowledge about where objects should lie inside each image volume while simultaneously encouraging learned features to consider different spatial scales in computing their own contributions without additional hyperparameter tuning. This allows us to drastically reduce required supervision by eliminating negative examples during training. Experiments show that our approach performs comparably--and often superiorly--to state-of-the-art convolutional autoencoder models across three distinct medical datasets. Further evaluation through heatmap visualization indicates how specific portions of the model focus on details related to shape variability in highly variable tasks like prostate extraction."

Since all the training patches are automatically extracted within the organ's bounding box without any user inputs such that can be used to evaluate our algorithm under practical settings; henceforth our algorithm can provide better performances than supervised methods which require manual labels during experiments or more precisely we achieve faster predictions with slightly lower Dice results compared against traditional FCN/UNets algorithms when provided groundtruth supervision for network initialization during evaluation stages."

      "generation": "> Railway systems play an important role in transportation worldwide considering their versatility and low-cost availability to almost every user group, including passenger and freight traffic, agriculture or mining companies, public authorities etc. Due to these features they are considered as irreplaceable pieces of transport infrastructure. In many countries around the world railway system maintenance accounts one of the biggest costs related with its operation as it takes more than 50% of total train operations budget spent through whole year. Particularly maintenance cost grows significantly while using ballasted tracks as this specific type of track requires regular inspection in order to ensure safe traffic conditions which consequently leads to frequent renewals mainly due to accelerated wear of rails and formation caused by degrading of rail fastening. However, only visual identification can be used if the quality assessment method meets basic requirements such as simplicity (easy application in real time usage), affordability compared to other techniques applied, reliably based results to detect any kind of defects, capability to produce precise measurements so that further calculations could be made properly for necessary improvements where needed and last but not least ability to show high accuracy which would reduce chances for wrong judgments about actual situation on site which potentially could bring serious consequences. This makes visual methods reliable enough for conducting inspections under rough environmental conditions such as heavy rain or dense fog. Furthermore modern technology advancement allowed to extend traditional balladed geometry inspectors like wheel trolley (WT) and geodetic total station (TS) into mobile devices capable of capturing digital image data by utilizing machine vision algorithms. It was possible because both, TS and WT has been gradually replaced with new technologies allowing higher level of automation such as measuring instruments mounted directly onto railway vehicles (RVs). Moreover latest computerized measuring equipment started integrating laser scanners, photogrammetric cameras and GPS/GNSS receivers on RVs, making them multi purpose machines equipped mainly with laser ranging sensors (LRS) commonly operated either at visible light wavelength range (193-760 nm) with pulsed emitters delivering between few up to several hundreds kilowatts energy peaks per second (kW/PEPS)) - CARRIER LASERS, or even longer range IR Lasers (wavelength ranges from tens to"

However, accurate predictions usually require large annotated datasets which are often expensive to obtain manually. Active learning attempts to learn more efficiently without human interactions in obtaining ground-truth data, using only small available unannotated test samples as needed. In this work, we focus on active selection strategies that can simultaneously identify high utility samples (samples best suited for classification or regression tasks) and segments (instances within individual samples), when training deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). We propose training DCNN models on progressively selected samples with relaxed upper confidence bounds (RUB), where RUCB methods seek to relax overly high uncertainties caused by low variability regions near object boundaries within images. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the art methods, in terms of both performance measures and computational efficiency."

Since automatic image segmentation has been considered to be beyond state-of-the-art performance, new approaches that can achieve results comparable with the ones performed by humans remain highly desired and very challenging. With regard to this, we analyze the human process when performing manual image segmentation. Based on our observations gathered through video recordings in 32 subjects which indicate how humans select object seeds as well as how they decide which regions shall become part of their foregrounds or backgrounds of each region by assigning colors to them, a method inspired by these processes is proposed here. It generates three probability maps per category that are computed based upon several features selected using information theory such that pixels within regions showing strong correlation (in terms of statistical dependency) will receive more similar probabilities than those outside correlated regions. This idea was also motivated by analyzing color histograms during testing in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed approach is tested on five publically available datasets including both simple and natural images. According to quantitative comparison between the best reported methods and ours, it indicates that the overall average percentage increase over baselines ranges considerably as much as approximately 47% for FBIS dataset all the way up to around -0% for BSD500 dataset. For subjective evaluation, mean scores comparing our own experimental setup compared against another one were calculated per set where differences were not significant at p? = ?0.1 level of significance according to two tailed paired samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test except for MSRCv2, indicating that there may be improvements in design necessary before further study into what human decisions look like while doing the task at hand is pursued again after revisiting related literature on machine learning techniques specifically made available due recent progress being achieved lately regarding classification algorithms based off deep neural networks among others leading authors towards making possible advances already existing without needing huge volumes/amounts data anymore\u2026"

      "generation": "> Abstract \u2014 A novel adaptive (i.e., parameter free) \u00adsegmenta\u00adtion approach to improve the traditional SLIC algorithm for real-time applications in video processing, is presented based on modified Markov Random Fields model as well as a region growing technique. Initially, we present an improvement by applying a prefilter and by choosing appropriate pairwise terms of potential energy function during the clustering phase. After that, several improvements are explored to speed up this algorithm especially when many regions need to be computed very quickly while preserving accuracy and consistency. Also an improved algorithm with three different approaches for dealing the border problem among neighbor images is proposed. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposal under varied scenarios. Index Terms\u2013 Superpixels; Image Segmentation; Border Problem; SLIC; MRF. I. INTRODUCTION Image segmen - tation represents one the most important steps for any computer vision system to extract meaningful information fro m high-dimensional input data (like video or digital imag es). In fact, it helps understand scene connotations b y grouping similar pixels into homogeneous objects [1]. However th e task usually involves finding a good tradeoff between computational requirements like runtime and power consump t ion; also there is also the difficulty to define apriori parameters to characterize object boundaries properly without ambiguity because the nature itself is intrinsically complicated by noisy content, deformations at edges, overlapping featuresand other challenges inherent to each frame o f a video sequence [2][3] . These limitations make impossible to use classical heuristics approaches due to their reliance either on a single threshold value which leads towards poor performance results or more generally, on multiple control parameters whose values have proven difficult to determine both from automatic learning mechanisms as well as human inputs(which requires expert user intervention that can be time intensive), therefore negatively impact i ng application scalability[4]; however recent trends involving deep neural nets seem promising indeed. Hence motivated us to propose a new approach that does not rely upon such control param eters but rather adjusts its behaviour dynamically during training so that generalization capability increases along with decreasing error rates simultaneously thereby achieving better performan ce than existing methods did before.[5],[6"

      "generation": "> Abstract: We propose a new active contour model for image segmentation with inhomogeneities. The model is based on the minimization of a functional that combines the length of the contour with a data term that is based on the orthogonal primary functions (OPFs) of the image. The OPFs are a set of functions that are orthogonal to the image gradient and are used to represent the image inhomogeneities. The OPFs are estimated using a novel method that is based on the solution of a system of linear equations. The proposed model is compared to the level set active contour model and the active contour model based on the total variation (TV) regularization. The results show that the proposed model is able to segment images with inhomogeneities more accurately than the other two models.\n\nThe paper is available here."

      "generation": "> We describe an extension and implementation of a recently proposed technique which combines edge detection and active contours using orthogonal-primary functions (OFP). This new method uses only the first order primals, does not use explicit control parameters such as curvature and surface tension for minimization and leads to very fast computation times compared with traditional active contours, while offering superior segmentations especially around areas that can be difficult to represent mathematically but are easily perceptible when manually drawn. Our goal here is to adapt this model in order to avoid some of its limitations by applying it to images containing weak variations rather than those possessing strong homogeneous regions separated by discontinuities. To do so we employ information extracted through multi-scale image filters followed by simple threshold selection to classify pixels into two or three classes each time where these classes correspond to areas which will make up our object/region boundaries. Using this data the OFP contours then determine accurate region boundaries even if there are few points present that truly indicate the existence of different intensities corresponding to boundaries between objects within a segmented image and yet still retain great computational efficiency."

      "generation": "> With increasing availability and efficiency in magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition, MRI has become an indispensable tool to study joints such as knee without invasive procedures or exposure to any ionizing radiation. In order to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying musculoskeletal pathology it becomes necessary to segment out tissues of interest for disease progression in addition to motion pattern tracking through time series data. This process generally involves the interpretation by human experts who then manually mark tissue boundaries using free hand tools. The manual region delineation requires substantial computing power while being expensive making clinical use very difficult. On similar lines automated approaches that make minimal assumptions by learning features are capable of overcoming most of these bottlenecks but require large labeled datasets during training that necessitates significant expert labour resulting into low performance accuracy. Most recently deep network based methods have been shown to deliver improved results compared with conventional machine learning classifiers which provide better initial starting model parameters thereby reducing feature extraction latency. Moreover deep convolutional networks allow direct classification of pixels/voxels as positive or negative examples whereby significantly reducing false negatives because each voxel can be directly categorized as positive of background leading to more robust joint boundary predictions than using the traditional foreground/background approach for classification. Also recent efforts involving graphical models trained on deformation parameters have performed well for joint segmentation; moreover using deep features along with deformations further improves estimation errors considerably. Here we provide a systematic survey of existing literature about developing algorithms to aid medical practitioners perform analysis from joint MR images based upon pixel values rather than relying on them to label tissues of interest (segmenting). We discuss methods developed for three types of techniques : feature classifier, statistical shape model, and deep learning methods that assist in the segmentation pipeline. Finally we present our thoughts and insights into future directions likely to improve automatic joint regions delineation"

A randomized selection process removes lower-density seeds with low cost functions that balance local accuracy vs. global smoothness between trees ensuring convergence with minimal user inputs.

Despite having much less data than dense pixel classification during training, our proposed method consistently outperforms prior art on both indoor category segmenta tion and outdoor vehicle parsing datasets even without using deep supervision. We also investigate how to design a boundary detection loss for accurate localization and demonstrate that the CaED architecture alone can improve over a stateof-theart instance segmentor with the latter\u2019s bounding box decoder when applied at classification time."

      "generation": "> An automated system which identifies and segments important landmarks in medical images could play an extremely valuable role in improving clinical decisions and diagnosis during routine care or emergency treatment. This work combines evolutionary optimization with an algorithm that detects image regions based on their appearance, texture and location properties. Such region selection can be performed iteratively to identify and segment multiple sets of pixels in order to locate and delimitate various types of objects in 2D (and potentially also 3D) space. Thus, our algorithm can automatically find particular characteristics of interest within large scale datasets such as X-ray radiographs, CT scans and MRIs. Our proposed method involves two main stages to perform pixel classification: 1) a feature extraction stage using a modified version of the Genetic Algorithm with binary representation; then 2) a new fitness function definition incorporating several descriptive parameters about extracted features and clustering them together along with a novel merging rule strategy to ensure optimal clustering results at each round of iteration. We demonstrate how our technique can be used not only to classify different kinds of medical records and diagnoses but we also include details on testing these procedures extensively on MRI brain, chest thorax and abdomen CT scan images and the Fibroscan software. Experiments conducted indicate that significant improvements both in terms of speed of operation and accuracy are achievable compared to previous systems and methods. One key performance metric reveals up a five time increase in the maximum achievable compression by the JPEG encoder through a reduction in noise.\n\nWe've posted previously here on the website about an EvoDevo algorithm written about here."

      "generation": "Abstract - Computed tomography (CT) imaging has revolutionized liver disease diagnosis by increasing clinical sensitivity to detect early-stage hepatopathies, which are reversible conditions when effectively treated and have a major impact on reducing mortality caused by these diseases. However, current automatic methods to classify abnormal cases as healthy or not rely exclusively on an exhaustive study involving manual segmentations of relevant organs in several images. These tasks might be tedious, repetitive, and sometimes even dangerous due to radiation exposure associated with X-ray CT scanning techniques [23]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop accurate algorithms based only on automatically extracted features that enable automated detection without requiring any prior information such as patient gender, age, or medical history. This work presents a data-driven framework capable of accurately identifying spleno-hepatic cirrhosis through the quantitative analysis of morphology variations among different regions within whole slices containing all liver segments. To achieve this goal two deep learning architectures are proposed namely Local Descriptors Encoding (LDE), a fully convolution architecture specialized in encoding global shape kernels and Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), specifically designed to perform feature matching for unsupervised training based on conditional latent embedding spaces spanned jointly between semantic embeddings learned during encoder\u2019s phase, allowing subsequent reconstruction. A preliminary evaluation was performed evaluating our approach at correctly discriminating samples belonging into two classes of abnormality present in public database of Computed Tomograms available through Open Science Framework repository created under project called SPLENICOMA 10K, showing promising results. Future works include testing on publicly available databases and validated under FDA/CE protocols."

Generally speaking, in all these existing algorithms there exist four main steps to be taken into account namely, (i) selection of region growing neighborhood; (ii) finding seed(set) locations where the regions are going to grow, in most cases it depends on visual appearance cues; next,(iii) merges with any neighbor that can\u2019t be further divided into more pixels because these have the same characteristics of its own and at last(iv). the extraction of meaningful boundaries between them by means of labeling process. Therefore if any step fails then whole process will fail resulting no accurate results. Although, some attempts were also made towards semi automatic segmentation method [1] which provide the user control over the generated contours but requires more time. Instead in our previous works, we proposed automatic color based region growing algorithm without any human interaction for object segmentation[2][3]. Unfortunately like every piece of technology it was also flaw with certain limitations. Among which, the main disadvantage was poor definition of edges produced due to lack of spatial information contained in square elements. Also when compared our result to ground truth images available in COIL-100 database [4] it does improve the accuracy, however in real applications where fine details plays a significant role it performs reasonably well. Taking consideration above drawbacks regarding quality analysis, finally we developed novel efficient system for multi resolution segmentation methodology. Now we use rectangular shaped elemental region-based growing instead of square block as basic block size unit which helps in reducing spatial dependency between pixels inside the same boundary. Further in order to reduce computational cost we replaced traditional region growing procedure to hierarchical strategy by selecting large set of candidate objects rather taking one nearest pixel only at each step during growing phase with a predefined condition under non maximizing stopping criteria. We found experimentally that these modifications yield good efficiency in terms of classification performance since they both help in better recognition rate by achieving good contrast and improving the discrimination power within the overlapping areas.

      "generation": "Graph images can be extracted by edge preserving bilateral filtering followed by morphological operations, such as removing tiny objects and merging adjacent objects. In this manner an approximate graph representation of regions in an image can be modeled which enables us to obtain meaningful partitions by assigning connected pixels together as segments with uniform and similar region color and gray levels. Since edge detectors are not perfect, it may happen that small isolated areas appear in the segmented output due to over-segmentation. A post processing phase using watershed algorithm should hence be included after initial segmentation to remove these unwanted extra contours (isolated area removal) while maintaining boundaries among main foreground objects. This process also allows handling complex shapes including thin structures like road networks where standard region growing methods fail to properly define object edges since they assume regions are surrounded completely either by background or other adjacent areas but no thin lines. This method includes three important algorithms: (i) Edge detection through Bilateral Filtering; (ii) Region partition using Markov Random Fields formulation of MRF algorithm (iii) Watershede algorithm for boundary refinement\n\nThe proposed architecture uses FPGA hardware implementation techniques of parallelization and pipelining so as to achieve maximum efficiency & speed when designing image recognition solutions. As compared to traditional CPU implementations the same design achieves up to 10 times improvement in efficiency even though GPU options could have been further explored as well - however we have avoided it here due to our goal being primarily to present one efficient solution rather than extensively comparing competing options within limitations posed by time constraints during development stage (for e., achieving 75% execution speed increase on typical hardware)."

      "generation": "> Image segmentation plays an important role in many 3D computer vision tasks, such as medical image analysis and simulation visualization. Recently, several 2D deep neural networks have achieved high classification accuracy on various datasets for the task of semantic labeling or object recognition. To exploit those techniques to a larger field of view (FOV), many researchers turn to apply these models in segmenting objects from their 2D slices obtained by volumetric data or the virtual reality data generated by light-field camera technology. However, those methods either do not produce continuous surfaces because they use sparse voxels/volume elements (aka volumetric voxel models) without topological guarantees after learning based on their training samples, whose surfaces are usually discrete meshes even being interpolated with a low degree surface reconstruction method; or produce non watertight results owing to those low order smoothed discretizations [8]. Furthermore, it does take long time for each sample to be reconstituted only using its corresponding single plane sliced from a 4D tensor representation where its 3 dimensions correspond to its height, width and depth respectively, which would result into poor efficiency if it involves millions of labeled images that cannot all be stored in memory (i.e., out-of-memory problem). In this work we aim at developing fast geometric processing algorithms in the form of geodesics so that most existing machine learning classification tools can handle any data set efficiently while producing satisfying segmentations for almost all desired shapes and sizes on large scale. Specifically, our framework constructs 12 connected components through a few iterative steps firstly instead of extracting features pointwise before applying any regression model according to their associated labels in learning procedures. Then those subsets will be joined together after learning with a linear program solver given some known geometrical information about how each subset connects to adjacent ones, e.g., edges and corners. Our strategy has shown its feasibility and promise when handling both synthetic test cases and clinical real life cardiac MRI patient dataset due to its ability to guarantee geometry constraints during training processes under constrains of efficient computation complexity and effective data processing capacity compared to other works [6] based on VR-data generation algorithms like"

It not only detects but also classifies crops as well as weeds using various machine learning techniques. Many algorithms have been proposed so far on crop classification based on supervised methods that need prior training data, which are expensive human labels. Unsupervised deep learning approaches can be used if there exists sufficient unlabelled datasets available; however many real life problems do not fall under these categories due to limited accessibility or availability of labelled dataset. Thereby, semi-automated image processing could benefit agricultural industry by providing a complete system consisting hardware configuration (i.e., UAV) for fast collection of imagery data along with feature extraction through artificial intelligent models to predict the exact location of crops/weed plants within a given geographical region. In this study, we propose an end to end automatic model driven database generation approach using Generative Adversarial Networks [7] GAN, Conditional Variational Autoencoder [6] CVAE and Adversarial Instance Norm Attack AI [18]. This system generates synthetic realistic crop and natural weed images when fed real world image collections. By integrating such synthetically generated multi scale and domain variants into existing CNN architectures as either preprocessing steps or auxiliary branch during training will help to enhance performance as it is capable to learn discriminative features across multidimensional samples from large volume of inputs in high resolutions."

The central idea is to leverage visual similarity between different locations in large-scale geo-referenced map databases such as Google Earth or Mapillary. The proposed framework operates in two phases; firstly, we predict a segmentation based on online maps with local search. Then the predicted outcome becomes available at training time which enables us to use supervised learning algorithms to find high order correlations among neighboring pixels within individual scenes. Our final results are achieved through two stage classification networks and demonstrate effectiveness of our semi-supervised learning approach compared to standard supervised methods without using any labeled imagery for training ."

(2) If it were possible to decrease parameter counts without loss of predictive accuracy, how much would computational efficiency improve? We answer both questions affirmatively using brain mapping---or paral- lel task-agnostic analysis---as a pretext problem. Specifically, we construct two architectures designed around reducing network volume while maintaining high performance on downstream clinical prediction tasks. One architecture uses an axial plane sparser approach wherein lateral/medial planes contain redundant features; another employs tensorizing. Finally, to address computational gains owing mostly to faster memory transfer due to reduced activation volumes, we propose a new metric termed Memory Throughput. Our metrics shed light into the relationships between different representations employed by our networks and the amount of computation per unit time required for inferencing at scale. For example, tensorization enables significantly higher memory throughput than axial parsing via more efficient data reuse, despite larger peak volumetric activations."

      "generation": "> We introduce a novel convolutional model (NConv) based on VoxNet to perform volumetric image segmentation that produces a per-voxel probability distribution over labeled classes in three dimensions, allowing accurate probabilistic volume rendering. Because our network operates at a voxel scale and we expect very large dataset, most probably too large for current machine learning hardware to deal with it without any special tricks such as transfer learning or feature reuse techniques, we propose a hybrid training strategy. In this strategy we precompute features using the first N layers (depth-wise separable if efficient computation necessary), train on these features using standard back propagation on a small subset, and then use stochastic gradient descent on the larger dataset. This approach allows us to keep data-independent parameters on the GPU memory and thus have enough data to learn useful high level features while speeding up the convergence thanks to warm start technique which saves half iteration of SGD (which require forward/backward for each epoch). It also allow easy implementation on CPU which requires much more RAM. Experimental results using the challenging CHAOS dataset show advantages of our technique compared to classic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) when increasing input size by one dimension. On images and masks where previous methods fail, ours succeeds. Also thanks to our method we are able to extract new information like probabilities for missing objects that was completely unknown due limited amount of supervision (manual annotation) in each class' mask.\n\nTags: Tverskiy"

In comparison, Graph Cuts (GC) based algorithms are fast, accurate and efficient but often limited to low resolution input due to their lack of high level contextual information obtained by CNN based models . To address this problem we propose a deep learning based framework composed by multiple feature map based k Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) descriptors which dynamically combine image edge and intensity similarity features at GC energy minimization stage. Our proposal has two main benefits; firstly it allows one to perform segmentation even though our pretrained model was trained only using a small training set size because it allows our algorithm to learn different feature representations from unsegmented training samples before applying them to specific organ types. It uses the extracted feature representation as contextual knowledge about the organ being inspected during computation without need of more trainings like required with other classification methods. Secondly, combining both region (similarities between adjacent pixels) and border (distance measures applied to all other regions) features leads in most cases to significant performance improvements regarding previously reported works [15]. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments performed on publicly available databases on three challenging clinical organ detection problems; fetus heart [1], brain blood clots identification [2] and kidney boundary delineations [3,4 and 5]. All experiments confirmed that proposed approach generally outperforms existing approaches especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted datasets resulting for instance from motion artifacts. More specifically, the use of learned global and local feature selection mechanism allowed us to handle real acquisition parameters, i.e., nonlinear deformability of objects , illumination/contrast variations affecting the object edges, while producing highly precise detected object boundaries thanks to the adopted active contour. Its application shows very promising results compared to state of the art machine vision based segmentation methods, specially with regards to the amount of noise, blurriness and occlusions encountered in a real acquisition environment ."

      "generation": "> A conditional random field (CRF) has been widely used to deal with labeling problems. Given an image dataset, each training data consists a segmented map as the ground truth, along with the corresponding original image and labeled map that are obtained by some unsupervised methods such as normalized cuts or watershed transformation. In this work we design the local potentials in a structured output framework of CRM-influenced tree Boltzmann machine. Our approach is efficient because it only needs scaled matrix multiplication rather than full matrix inversion. Besides, one additional weight constraint makes our method feasible to be trained under gradient based backpropagation algorithm. It offers flexibility to optimize different objective functions. We also show that incorporating regularization loss term helps improving accuracy at a small cost of speed. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model successfully models tree probability distributions."

This method was developed as part of a competition held at International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2018, ISIC/Challenge 3 in June 2019 with participants worldwide. The overall idea proposed by the authors follows three steps. Firstly, the skin region has been identified with Mask R-CNN Network[]. In this work, the pretrained model [COCO][] was used since it provided more precise boundary detection compared to publicly available models. Second step consisted in applying k-means clustering algorithm of pixel colors to find out pixels belonging to lesion or not. Since melanomas can vary greatly in appearance due to their various stages of maturation and growth, the model needs several different training sets of color variations found through literature review. Finally, the result obtained after the first two steps were given to four regression networks in an ensemble framework [] such that each network can focus on particular stage without being disturbed by irrelevant data points. The performance of this system achieved state-of-the-art results according to evaluation performed during the challenge which is shown with top accuracy score within its category."

      "generation": "In medical image segmentation, we are given only noisy and sometimes very small amounts of training data and thus need an initial estimation (which is often not ideal) to drive further improvements upon using various regularization schemes. We propose a learning framework aiming at iteratively estimating such parameters from only partially annotated imagery data. A key component which enables this is our algorithmic solution on normalizing input images so that different modalities can now be processed uniformly without sacrificing resolution even with potentially smaller datasets and less information per case available for fine-tuning. For evaluation purposes, it was demonstrated on 618 MRIs scans using publicly domain T2-weighted brain MRI scans where the ground truth labels were provided, showing encouraging mean Dice scores of 0.78 and 0.95 across hemispheres based upon just five randomly selected slices and four classes for each scan, respectively. Moreover, these results have also significantly surpassed similar but separate baseline experiments conducted in both single slice and multi-slice settings using state-of-art algorithms. To demonstrate feasibility of the proposed method across multiple organs of interest as well as their variability under distinct pathologies in clinical cases, an additional set of 34 ultrasonography volumes containing ten different subjects acquired from non-profit hospitals were collected, resulting in promising qualitative findings."

These were then combined to form an enhanced two channel feature set for training classifiers on pixel-level labelling data for 4 classes: Background; Bladder wall, Rectum wall, Cancer lesion & Periphery Zone. Experiments were first conducted on 3 subjects in the HIPRA test database of 79 3D US image volumes containing all four labels. An accuracy score greater than 93% is achieved when averaged across all subject labels within each volume. Performance increases to beyond 89% on held-out validation subjects without requiring any further retraining.

This enables us to optimize over sets of arbitrarily complex shape priors defined exclusively using differentiable functions; we show our approach to outperform previous methods on non-parametric shape prior estimation. We apply the proposed MCMC methods for unsupervised image segmentation by integrating out shapes, while encoding spatial regularizations conditionally on observed pixel labels to learn an efficient shape space representation. We leverage existing shape learning priors directly: e.g., graph-based shape representations enable automatic labeling of brain tumours and vessels. A strong connection between our methodology and standard sampling techniques is demonstrated; for example variants to Gibbs sampling are derived analytically revealing interpretations based both on model evidence and predictive distributions."

It turns out to be possible to use standard methods involving gradient descent search method on the finite dimensional tangent space at v without using explicit expressions. Thus it is straightforward to adapt existing tools e.g., nonlinear optimization based solvers, parallel computation over the vertices for efficient implementation. As shown through numerical testing and comparisons to other algorithms designed for discrete data sets, the proposed approach succeeds as a fast convergence approximation towards true minimum when tested against random noise on simple shapes."

In this model, two different combinations between image components are proposed as constraints for the optimization, achieving combinatorial selection over candidates according to mutual associations among them instead of single instance prediction of individual data points that commonly exist in existing works. Unlike conventional approaches such as CNN-based supervised methods and traditional CRF/DPM approaches, our method does not assume any type of predefined label space nor need external class priors to learn labels from it. On top of these advantages, its simple network architecture makes it more generalizable yet faster to converge when dealing with large datasets as well as complex inputs unlike those based on high capacity neural networks that require huge amounts of GPU memory as required by many other popular deep models. Last but not least, the algorithmic framework implemented here offers great convenience due to its simplicity compared to existing state-of-the-art methods which involve multiples layers iteratively going back into nonlinearities during each pass before updating parameters. All these traits make us strongly believe that using less complicated machine learning models could be equally effective while being more efficient at same time rather than just depending only upon powerful computing resources alone."

Such 3D data can prove to be more robust than traditional 2D representation since it represents an image space as well as its underlying geometry. A richer dataset will encourage better generalization ability of deep models trained with synthetic data. In this work, we introduce  a dynamic four-dimensional (4D) light-field dataset consisting of  real world everyday scenes captured through a plenoptic camera which can record objects over multiple views, multiple exposure time and variable speed. This is the first ever dataset collected according the above mentioned criteria. We believe that such high variety will improve generality of object analysis methodologies including classification, recognition and detection tasks. Next, using our data set we propose two different end-to-end techniques to perform material identification on arbitrary shapes across various lighting conditions and environments, directly from capturing device. Our approach does not rely on any model/scene initialization unlike [6], nor needs any segmentation inputs like existing deep learning methods [7]. Finally, we evaluate performance gains by using realistic 4-D data sets during training relative to traditionally preprocessed conventional input formats and compare results with other approaches. Results show noticeable improvement when compared against competing deep models in terms accuracy using similar architectural parameters.\""

      "generation": "> Accurate segmentation by electron microscope (EM) images in subcellular scale is crucial for biological study and medical diagnosis, where manual annotation are time consuming or even impossible to produce due to the high resolution and huge amount EM data acquired by cutting-edge equipment such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). As with typical supervised segmentation problems on single EM image, deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have yielded impressive performance that require large amounts 2D training patches annotated for accuracy. However, these conventional solutions face challenges when trained on only small datasets since they often contain limited diversity and may fail generalizing the unseen variations beyond what human experts commonly annotate. Semisupervise setting can alleviate this problem by utilizing additional weakly labeled data without requiring extensive hand annotations while also maintaining reasonable time complexity. In particular, we use a novel form of augmentation called hierarchial merge tree (HMT), which generates rich semantically consistent labels to exploit the abundance of low quality input 3D volume captured by electron tomographs but lack structure detail. To take advantage of prior knowledge about biomedical tissue structures, HMT labels include not only organelle boundaries but also cell regions formed by several smaller organelles. Such coarse but more robust information then guides DWN classification results further refined at finer levels. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our framework over vanilla networks and alternative semi-sersified segmentation systems, indicating its potential to be applied into clinical applications like cancer prognosis using electron micrography imagery."

Here we propose the first SP-based neural network architecture by combining both the SP concept along with ideas found successful recently in deep learning structures such as inception modules in tandem with multiple superpixel partitions. We refer to these new models which generalize previous superpixels based classifiers e.g., SAP [1] as SPNets. Our contribution includes presenting three novel neural network formulations that allow us to explore various tradeoffs between input resolution, spatial consistency preservation among superpixels, amount to superpixel information redundancy loss during training - all while maintaining high classification performance. We demonstrate experimentally on public datasets like CIFAR and SVHN our method works well even when trained on small subset of samples compared to standard CNN architecture with similar accuracy rates. Sensitivity tests across different SP configurations are performed showing how the use of the same network with multiple partitionings results in reduced superpixel variability under parameter space search. Finally, further evaluating our approach with more real world data via 3D imagery suggests its potential deployment beyond traditional monocular tasks."

In some scenarios with structured input or output (either sequences or matrices), it may be beneficial to incorporate additional information into the network via structural regularization. However, adding structure usually increases expressiveness at an exponential cost since the number of parameters in such model scales up rapidly compared to purely feedforward ones, which in practice makes them overfit easily on available data without proper regularization methods.\n2\n3 In this work we look into ways of efficiently employing these kinds of models while maintaining accuracy using only small amounts of unlabeled data. More specifically our goal is to introduce a new approach that addresses computational efficiency issues during test time by proposing piece-wise solutions based only on the data needed to perform inference - without imposing any prior regularity assumptions. We are able to achieve our objective under very mild conditions. Furthermore several other advantages are discussed including memory reduction during forward propagation and ability to handle non iid datasets. Experiments show significant reduction for test time complexity w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches when applied to dense prediction problems.

Most existing methods focus on the category-level semantic segmentation, which predicts a label for each pixel. However, in many applications, instance-level semantic segmentation is also required, which predicts a label for each instance in an image. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to bridge category-level and instance-level semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel instance-level semantic segmentation method, which is based on the category-level semantic segmentation method. Then, we propose a novel category-level semantic segmentation method, which is based on the instance-level semantic segmentation method. We show that our framework can effectively bridge category-level and instance-level semantic segmentation. We evaluate our framework on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Our results show that our framework can effectively bridge category-level and instance-level semantic segmentation.\n\nThe paper is available here."

      "generation": "In order to be able to generalize in real life applications, semantic image segmentation models need to produce fine detailed information such as instance boundaries correctly. Typical end-to-end algorithms trained with only category labels can only perform well along smooth class regions and fail at objects and parts where localization matters. They often miss out on hard cases that involve different poses or partial occlusions between instances. This observation motivates us to bridge these two levels by introducing weak supervision based fine detail recovery tasks during training time so that we can recover more details even when there are missing/erroneous ground truths through strong segmentation prediction results. We introduce three novel designs including fine detail detection module (FDD), object proposal regularizer (PR) and part proposal regularizer (PAR). FDD enforces detailed structures while PR helps better deal with background noise while PAR leads to cleaner and smaller mask proposals in both dense and sparse attention networks. To demonstrate our method's effectiveness, we experimented on PASCAL VOC 12 and COCO datasets using two baseline deep learning architectures: FCN8s & Mask Rcnn and show competitive performance.\nThe paper was coauthored by Tiantian Huang, Bin Wang, Huihua Zhang, Yang Sun, Deyu Chao, Jili Shen.

      "generation": "> Fast semantic segmentation methods usually leverage low-level image features such as color and texture, which lead to suboptimal results in challenging conditions in various scenarios. In addition, current state-of-the-art techniques require deep networks or multi-scale convolutions during testing which make real time applications impractical due to heavy computations involved. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an efficient approach that leverages spatial context to propagate semantics among neighbor regions instead of learning complex representations based on large amounts of training images. Our method also adopts multiple layers via skip connections (or guided filters) between different feature levels, leading to high quality final results. In contrast to fully data driven approaches which learn pixel level information for every single class at once, our proposed algorithm focuses initially on two classes using only boundary pixels within small neighborhood patches followed by iteratively expanding segments until all the objects are identified accordingly without resorting to any post processing step. Such fast local refinement steps result in improved performance over baseline models while maintaining similar run times using only simple off-the shelf operators to handle both RGB and depth inputs. Experiments comparing our work against several state-of-the art algorithms showcase significant accuracy improvements with much faster runtime compared to other methods despite simpler implementation on most popular datasets including Oxford105K PascalVOC2007 and 2012, MS COCO, SUN397 and CamVid."

As shown in \\cite{Park2017Differential} these classes of method detect most objects without problems by simply considering a combination of several input frames; however when occlusion occurs they fail due to their intrinsic shortcomings related both externally (e.g., different viewpoint) or internally (overly sensitive boundaries). To address these issues we propose combining saliency prediction via machine learning and graph-cut optimization. Specifically, we focus on an object detector that learns not just edge detection but also other types of feature extraction for better segmentation performance while simultaneously being able to recover missing/incomplete features using our new technique called differential clustering. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy rate achieved during testing even under challenging conditions including high variations within objects themselves along with unpredictable backgrounds .\\\\\nThe goal of our approach is not only improving previous work concerning its computation time complexity but also providing useful visualizations which help users understand underlying mechanisms driving data acquisition process through application of human expertise into computer vision pipelines involving deep neural networks. This allows us to effectively solve real world tasks as long as necessary preprocessing steps have been properly addressed so as to make sure input images conform required properties such as cleanliness , color variation etc,...

We overcome these limitations to achieve state-of-the-art performance by introducing a novel dataset composed of 730 high resolution microscopy images containing neuron information, followed by fully automatic learning processes instead of handcrafted features (i.e., we automatically detect cells' centers and use them as inputs).

In particular, our contributions are twofold: firstly, in order to increase segmentation quality especially on noisy images with nonlinearity, we employ data dependent Gaussian mixture models as prior knowledge at pixels level via an adaptive fuzzy cmean kernel machine (AMFCMK) approach that enables incorporating the inherent nonlinear structure, which leads to better discontinuity detection; secondly, since most real world vision applications such as biomedical image processing require high resolution visualization in very limited timeframes thus fast implementation algorithms can be developed via an integral operator formulation. More specifically, through direct linear transformation technique applied both in offline phase and online phase, where only one matrix multiplication is needed every update step, the computational cost for AMFCMK algorithm has been reduced significantly down to about cubic speedup. With numerical experiments we will show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively comparing different scenarios for various benchmark greyworld images including Landsat remote sensing satellite imagery containing a great deal of speckle noise."

We address these issues and propose Integrate nal Infere ce Algorithm (IIA) that employs deep learning techniques combined with an iterative regularization scheme which allows us to perform the optimization efficiently. IIA adapts multiple SVM kernels to learn all levels of information effectively via a hierarchical strategy, where each level contains two major modules. One module consists of SVM components to capture low-dimensional manifolds using simple models based on a few inputs variables. Another module combines those linear discriminant analysis models into an overall classifier with additional neural networks layers that utilize more high-dimensional measurements obtained in previous stages. This method also involves a powerful inductive learning algorithm to train weights at each layer of SVMs to achieve accurate results. A theoretical convergence proof and extensive empirical comparisons show that our proposed approach provides stateof-the-art solutions outperforming current competitors particularly in highlynonlinearly complex systems and unconventional pattern classification tasks even with relatively smaller sample size. Our code based IIA will be soon made publicly available."

To overcome these drawbacks active contour models provide dynamic object representations that consider local data characteristics like edges, curves or boundaries through interactive deformable splines (snakes) under external force field forces or other energy minimization functions. This process can produce more reliable results with better accuracy depending largely on initial settings which can still be user-dependent thus defeating an automatic optimization methodology .

To provide some insights, we theoretically explore the relationship between MPNN/GN and variational autoencoders (VAEs). By adopting message passing inference paradigm, VAE uses neural encoder\u2013decoder architectures not only in reconstructing signals defined over Euclidean spaces but also over graphs where nodes are equipped with nonlinear features extracted by random walk sampling schemes. We provide empirical evidence about this relationship through multiple experiments involving two major components including node classification and semi-supervised learning tasks over real-world social-media data sets, which suggests that these networks perform remarkably well because they learn latent representations under explicit message exchange constraints that encode essential graph structures or characteristics."

In this paper, we propose a new approach to learning CRFs, which we call Bethe learning. Bethe learning is based on the Bethe free energy, which is a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the training data. We show that the Bethe free energy can be maximized by a simple iterative algorithm, which is closely related to the MAP decoding algorithm for CRFs. We also show that the Bethe free energy is a convex function of the parameters, and that the Bethe learning algorithm converges to a global optimum of the CLL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Bethe learning on a number of sequence labeling tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling.\n\nThe paper is available here."

Our proposed unsupervised model fitting technique builds upon ideas of message passing algorithms and maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding. These two paradigms converge to an identical solution, when applied iteratively using fixed parameters. By interlacing the standard MAP algorithm for the graphical CRF structure together with the forward\u2014backward recursions for computing messages over latent states associated with each edge, we arrive at two alternative implementations of Belief Propagation in the context of the exact inference scheme BP*. In doing so, we introduce novel connections between approximate message-passing algorithms, such as Expectation Maximization or Approximate Message Passing with Loopy Belief Propagation\u2014like updates (AMP-LBP), which are typically used in more complex scenarios than simple graphs. To circumvent spurious collateral conclusions that may occur due to this process being nonconvex within highly connected graphs, further techniques can be borrowed directly from recent literature, e.g., reparameterizing gradient variants thereof through continuous time relaxation. Consequently, it remains straightforward during training since these steps effectively require just updating local parameters while preserving the overall model formulation. Such flexibility allows seamless integration into our framework, offering substantial computational benefits during large scale processing in real world settings. Experimental evaluation on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance both compared to other state-of-the-art methods like Neural LSTM and BiRNN models but also significantly outperforming linear classifiers without any further fine tuning needed after pretrained initializations."

      "generation": "ABSTRACT\nBackground & Objectives: Image Segmentation, i.e., partitioning an input image into smaller homogeneous regions that could be represented as separate instances at different levels of abstraction within a model or can form the basis for further analysis, has been defined in various ways from either low-level to high-level features including color, texture descriptors, region adjacency, edges and lines, etc.(Prewitt [1] ; Shi& Malik 2000; Xue et al .2006a). In this work we propose a new approach for image segmentation which combines some properties obtained from global image criteria (GIC) such as entropy maximization and pixel compactness minimization with those of local level criteria (LLC), like similarity measure based optimization. This provides an unsupervised clustering scheme that utilizes GIC and LLC in order to produce a better semantic understanding from images' segmentation process.\nMaterials & Methods: In the proposed technique, pixels are assigned probabilities to belong to particular classes according to their own attributes so each class reflects one kind of distribution, where each cluster depends on the others through Markov random fields. These prior distributions are subsequently updated to represent posterior distributions after incorporating some of the global cues described above in terms of Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between given observations and the resulting estimates of these probability functions. After updating the initial guess of partitioning with both priors and updates derived from the two classes we get finally refined clusters. Furthermore, a novel objective quantitative evaluation criterion which takes into account spatial constraints to improve detection reliability was applied. Evaluations and validation were carried out using different benchmark datasets obtained at Caltech-101 [35] , UTD PASCAL( http://www.utdallas.edu/~lcvpr/) and PET imagery provided by MRC Hammersmith Hospital in London (http://fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslwiki ).

In cases where adequate dataset size is not practical to collect such as 3D brain imaging or tissue segmentation problem described here, we present an implementation technique that significantly improves gradient propagation with moderate loss function changes by exploiting model layer connectivity patterns at both forward and backward passes. We show results indicating our approach performs extremely well for image classification problems across multiple datasets. Experimental evaluation conducted on two real-world clinical datasets including BrainMagneticStimulation and 1650 slices of glioma MRI indicates considerable improvement over baseline algorithms achieving accuracy upwards of 98%, false negative rate downwards of .47%, specificity and sensitivity higher than baseline methods (more than one standard deviation difference shown in several cases). With minimal code modifications, we were able to reduce computational times approximately threefold, and achieve significant gains relative to other literature solutions by orders of magnitude. Further improvements to accuracy can be achieved if data generation is improved as discussed. Results presented here demonstrate strong evidence in potential benefits available when using sparse connectivity properties exhibited during backpropagation learning optimization along layer connections."

For all experiments the dataset\u2019s original size provided adequate training material even without cropping out organs like liver or stomach. Two types of results regarding each model were investigated :\n(a) The localization error which can be regarded as a measure for false negative detections of keypoint pairs.

Traditional methods are based on region characteristics, such as edge or boundary between different regions, to find segment boundaries so as to realize image segmentation results. But these feature-based extraction methods may lead to errors caused by noise interference during processing. However, since deep neural networks have developed in recent years, they have been used more widely and effectively applied in many fields because their parameters can be optimized directly through supervision data training process without manual guidance [2], which is suitable for automatic and high efficiency applications. In particular, U \u2013net and its improved algorithms are often adopted because they use end-to -end learning to learn more complete information about images in multiple scales and then output prediction results in pixels, thus realizing fine-grained classification tasks at pixel level well. And this paper adopts similar method U-Net++ using hierarchical encoder-decoder network structure to implement segmentation effect."

This approach limits the scope since shapes are generally unknown (for example when dealing with text). Also, while there might be an initial idea of how points will be arranged at the start of the process, this could change greatly after many points have already classified according to those criteria. Recently [2], a new algorithm was presented which used vector membership within each point rather than traditional geometry; this allows us more flexibility by having no assumption on shape, size, number of dimensions etc., while allowing easy control over specific characteristics like density distribution and spatial arrangement without needing much computation power available during execution time because these parameters can all still function effectively even if they were changed midway through processing - something unheard off until now!"

In particular we apply our results to constrained principal component analysis (PCA), robust sparse PCA, and regression problems where enforcing both global or local stationarity are required. We provide several examples in different applications to show that all these tasks can be modelled as an optimization problem over functions such as $\\int_0^T \\varphi(\\phi'(t)) \\; w( t) \\,dt $ where $\\omega$ has varying forms depending on the task we wish to perform but it also involves derivatives and possibly some regularizations terms. While these objectives have received less attention compared to standard PCA type settings, they are key issues in many important scenarios encountered in statistical learning theory. A large family of objective functionals of this form can be written as ${\\left( \\mathbf{f} , W\\mathbf{u}\\right)}_{H } = Y^TX f, $ subjected only the constraint $||\\mathbf{ u ||}_{V}^2= 1$, where $W$ is the kernel operator of the corresponding linear integral equation, leading us naturally into a discussion for the properties of their solution via the implicit formula. To further illustrate the wide applicability of our methodology we will discuss several applications at each step along the way including how to impose constraints on global or local variance stationary functions and mean-shift methods or Gaussian-RBF-Gaussian density estimation for multiple signals given their temporal evolution. Finally we propose an extension of the approach to handle arbitrary time series where the order of data acquisition does matter when computing the cross covariance matrix. This last part of work leads us toward a study of functional principal components analysis which allows us to model complex dynamic systems."

Furthermore, our solution will be able handle any kind of sensor or recording device whether the input is captured through a RGB camera, single CCD/CMOS or dual color line camera setup, standard video stream or multi-frame capture like Time-Of-Flight cameras typically employed due to their ability to penetrate smoke effectively compared to monochrome, or even multispectral imagery.

It involves firstly blurring the objects to appear indistinct, followed by depth estimation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and subsequently extracting their silhouettes so as to achieve semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques. This methodology relies on an observation that certain pixels in high depth of field (DOF) DSLR photographs are captured by many camera sensor cells causing strong diffraction peaks. This will result in such pixels having more intensity than neighboring non-overlapped ones with similar color. As a consequence, these pixels can be clipped at low spatial frequencies thus allowing us to define our depth cue. Based on this insight, the proposed framework consists primarily of two stages \u2013 one for predicting relative depth of every pixel within the scene, and another stage that incorporates this information into the final results. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide qualitative evaluation of various filter sizes utilized for generating pseudo DOF gradients via experiments on diverse datasets; 2) we demonstrate robustness of our approach over different background colors and textures through quantitative evaluations. We show our system surpasses existing techniques in literature by up to about 3%."

The 3D model is used to generate a set of candidate segmentations, which are then evaluated using a set of image features. The best segmentation is then selected based on these features.

      "generation": "## Introduction\n\nImage segmentation and restoration are critical to many applications such as medical imaging [35], human/object recognition [24, 16] or video coding [47]. One approach that has shown great promise concerns segmentation/restoration by low rank matrix completion formulation (e.g., see a survey on graph-based formulations such as spectral clustering [60]). However, it remains challenging because of various issues related to noise, outliers, corruptions in images along with their interactions; they can all lead to false groupings or inaccurate recovery. In this regard, our proposed penalty functional aims at finding smooth patches that fit into regions containing missing pixels while also reducing noise propagation effects within regions. The main contributions involve developing novel linear operators (for both patch matching and regularizing) based upon geometric properties such as arc length/curvature and employing these operators iteratively through alternating minimizations. Our preliminary experiments using natural images have obtained promising results compared against existing methods, including an improvement of about one stop for restoring blurred pictures. This work was made possible thanks to two recent developments presented hereafter.\nThe first development regards extending existing nonlinear operator theory tools in order to create corresponding linear counterparts relevant under certain conditions\u2014such a change allows us the computational advantage inherent to working directly with vectors rather than more complex structures such as manifolds where computation costs become significant due not only having multiple degrees but other dimensions added like normal space components per vertex\u2026etc This technique allows us not only speed up calculations but also provides useful information when dealing with curvatures which play large role during our optimization process(es). Additionally we explore ways we could potentially minimize some types unstable solutions caused by numerical perturbations given data set size constraints usually associated with real world problems requiring higher accuracy outputs without sacrificing efficiency levels necessary if successful outcome is required.\nSecondly we use LSODA integrator solver to tackle time dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), especially those modeling material behavior over a period of time; doing so helps achieve faster convergence rates at lower cost than traditional methods do even though they still provide good performance . We expect people who take this course will further investigate how exactly this works since there are"

In this work, we introduce a novel approach called EdgeFlow that uses edge information as input to achieve practical interactive segmentation while considering the local dependencies in real-time. Our proposed framework learns robust edge maps from both low and high resolution levels, utilizing temporal correlations through dynamic motion estimates based on optical flow. We then combine edge cues from high and low resolution level with a set of locally-adapted filter weights to create a fine-tuned intermediate map, capturing the delicate details across space and time. Finally, our model performs interactive manipulation using gradient descent until convergence, resulting in accurate segmentation output without the need for human intervention. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating outperformances over classical approaches by preserving more detailed spatial patterns while achieving significantly faster processing times."

However, one of the main challenges in this task is the imbalance between the number of input and output classes. This imbalance can lead to poor performance in the segmentation task, as the model tends to focus more on the majority class and neglect the minority classes. In this paper, we propose a new loss function called Combo Loss, which addresses this issue by combining two different loss functions: cross-entropy loss and Dice loss. The cross-entropy loss is used to penalize the model for incorrect predictions, while the Dice loss is used to penalize the model for poor overlap between the predicted and ground-truth segmentations. By combining these two loss functions, Combo Loss is able to better handle input and output imbalance in multi-organ segmentation tasks. We evaluate Combo Loss on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness to class imbalance."

This work addresses the issue of mining relevant features that capture the relation between pixels and other objects or regions in the image.

Our method leverages the geometric properties of inter-extreme points to learn a mapping between the input image and a set of labeled images. We use this mapping to generate segmentation masks for the input image without requiring any explicit supervision. Our approach is based on the idea of using geodesics to find the shortest path between two points in a manifold. We extend this idea to the context of image segmentation by defining a manifold of labeled images and finding the shortest path between the input image and a set of labeled images. We use this path to generate a segmentation mask for the input image. Our approach is weakly supervised, meaning that we only require a small number of labeled images to generate accurate segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed."

IEPs are points in images that can be computed from a small region around them using geometric properties such as distance and angles, without requiring explicit object detection or pixel-level labeling. In our work, we explore their potential in weakly supervised automatic segmentation by analyzing their structural relationships with local neighbors and other regions within an image.\n\nWe show that IEPs possess rich information about object boundaries, shape, texture, and contextual hierarchy, which makes them well suited for weak supervision. However, direct use of IEPs is limited by their low resolution compared with pixels, leading to spatial ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that constructs intermediate representations between spatial neighborhoods and pixels based on smooth 3-D geodetic paths connecting extreme points across regions with similar geometric structures. Our scheme explicitly exploits spatial continuity, while preserving local geometric relationships among elements in these regions.\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of intermediate levels of supervisory information using IEPs to improve accuracy for both unsupervised and semi-supervised image segmentation tasks. It also enables visualization of underlying image structure through analysis of IEP cluster connectivity patterns. Overall, our proposed method offers new insights into interpreting spatial hierarchy and integrating nonlocal features at various scales and resolutions for weakly supervised image processing in computer vision applications."

Our method is based on adversarial networks and can handle noisy and imprecise label distributions by leveraging contextual information during training and inference. Specifically, our framework consists of two modules: first, an encoder converts 3D point cloud data into feature vectors; second, decoders map these feature vectors back into polygonal shapes while preserving contextual details using conditional GANs. By combining multiple iterative cycles of predictive modeling and adversarial refinement, P2P produces highly accurate segments with minimal human intervention. Evaluations show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for handling challenging scenarios such as occlusion, clutter, and complex geometries."

However, recent research shows that previous approaches suffer from significant limitations when applied to graphs with degree 4 or more vertices as their number increases rapidly while still maintaining a feasible graph structure. To address this issue, we propose an efficient approach based on the degree-4 sum of squares hierarchy (DSSH), which efficiently generates lower bounds for exact solutions to problems over these graphs.\r\n\r\nOur proposed method involves representing each vertex node using its degree vector, so that a solution can be considered a valid assignment if it satisfies the DSSH constraints. We then develop algorithms based on dynamic programming to generate such assignments systematically, starting with small subproblems containing fewer nodes and iterating towards larger ones. Our results show improvements in efficiency of order O(N log N) compared to previous methods with the same level of accuracy. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, our work contributes significantly towards understanding the structure of degree-4 graphs using mathematical analysis and theoretical insights, paving the way for future development of efficient exact inference techniques specifically tailored to meet these needs. Overall, our findings offer new avenues for research and the potential for significant advancements in applying combinatorial optimization techniques to real-world scenarios involving complex networks.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this paper presents an innovative approach to exact inference in graphs using the degree-4 sum of squares hierarchy, resulting in improved efficiency and better understanding of the underlying graph structures."

In this study, we propose an ensemble learning model combining multiple classifiers predicting confidence scores for polyp location. These confidence scores are integrated using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation (CLPSO) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness in detecting polyps from CT scans.\n\nIn the first phase, three classifiers namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with different hyper-parameters were trained on their respective datasets. Each classifier outputs probabilities or thresholds for each image pixel being polyp or not. The output probability maps from single models had overlapping regions due to varying strengths among classifiers. To address this issue, we proposed fusing the model predictions by thresholded nonlinear pooling operations. We calculated weighted average prediction confidence scores to generate a set of discriminative features representing unique characteristics of polyps across images.\n\nThe second phase introduced CLPSO as a metaheuristic approach that globally searched for optimal configurations of fusion weights between individual components within each feature group while considering both classification performance metrics and feature relevance measures. By exploring the search space iteratively under specific constraints, it produced highly accurate results even when input data was noisy. Furthermore, it enhanced precision of polyp detection in challenging cases like flat or small lesions.\n    \nOverall, our method can integrate diverse expertise of multiple models into one synergizing system that adapts quickly to complex medical imagery through a novel optimization strategy."

One of the most popular techniques is based on deep learning models such as U-Net or Mask R-CNN, which can effectively capture complex patterns and relationships between pixels. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data and computation resources, making them impractical for many real-world applications. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose an alternative approach that leverages adversarial attention gates to enhance feature extraction during training while reducing computational complexity significantly. Our model utilizes multi-scale attention gates to focus on important regions when generating segments. Specifically, it employs two types of attention gates: one at input level and another at output level. \n\nDuring training, the input gate selectively masks out irrelevant features, allowing the output level attention to refine only useful information. The resultant representations are then concatenated with additional inputs before feeding into a final segmentation network. This process allows our method to learn more efficiently by selecting only relevant features and thus reduces its dependence on large-scale labels. Additionally, it results in better accuracy due to the ability to ignore background noise or distortions.\n\nWe evaluate our model's performance and demonstrate improved accuracies compared to existing baselines in a range of scenarios including medical image segmentation, object detection, and text classification. Results show significant improvement especially when dealing with limited labeled data. By providing a novel solution to the problem of sparse labeled data, this work paves the way for future developments in both theoretical as well as practical domains with potential implications across various industries."

In this study, we explore the use of contrastive registration for unsupervised image segmentation of brain MRIs. We propose a novel approach that utilizes both local intensity-based contrasts and global shape-based contrasts to improve the performance of our model. Our experiments show a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy when using these contrasts together, particularly in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can effectively handle various types of artifacts commonly found in medical images. This work presents a valuable contribution to the field of unsupervised medical image segmentation by providing improved accuracy and robustness through the use of contrastive registration techniques."

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that do not utilize knowledge transfer. Our results suggest that knowledge transfer is a powerful technique for improving the performance of medical image segmentation models, and that our approach can be easily applied to a wide range of segmentation models and datasets."

Most current approaches rely on domain adaptation or network architecture variations specific to the target modality which can limit their generalizability and applicability across different datasets. In this study, we propose a novel framework that leverages adversarial training to facilitate network-agnostic knowledge transfer between modalities using only a limited amount of labeled data. We demonstrate effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark tasks, liver segmentation in CT and MR images, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal modifications to existing models. Our findings highlight the potential of domain agnostic learning strategies for improving model applicability and reducing transfer requirements."

This paper presents a novel approach that combines non-parametric density estimation with hierarchical clustering methods to perform image segmentation without the need for prior knowledge of the underlying distribution or parameterization of the image pixels. The proposed method first uses a non-parametric density estimator, such as kernel density estimation (KDE), to estimate the probability density function of the pixel intensity values. By analyzing the local maxima of the estimated density function, we obtain clusters of pixels that represent the different regions within the image. These clusters are then subjected to hierarchical clustering to create a more meaningful grouping and partitioning of similar pixels based on their spatial relationship within the image. Results from experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating that it is able to accurately segment images even when dealing with varying intensities and noise levels"

First, we introduce three new loss functions, namely cross-entropy with conditional random fields (CCE), symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence with gradient penalty (SKLDG), and adversarial regularization (RGADV). These functions incorporate not only image-level information but also pixel-level guidance provided by weak label supervision. By leveraging these novel loss functions together with shared parameter networks (SPNs) and dynamic network slicing (DNS), a multi-network architecture is then proposed to enhance inter-task collaboration and task adaptation under different conditions. Finally, our architecture is tested on various publicly available datasets using multiple performance metrics relevant to medical diagnosis.

The proposed method involves defining a set of rules that govern the behavior of cells in a grid, and then iteratively applying these rules to generate segments that represent the objects in the image. The segments are grown by adding cells that satisfy certain conditions, and the process is repeated until the desired level of detail is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on a variety of images, and the results are compared to those obtained using other state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. The results show that the proposed method is able to accurately segment images with a high degree of precision, and that it is particularly well-suited for images with complex structures and overlapping objects."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that uses region-of-interest (ROI)-guided supervoxel inpainting to enhance self-supervised learning. Our method improves data efficiency by focusing on salient regions during generation while still generating high quality masks at low computational costs. We evaluate our approach using various datasets and show improvement compared to existing approaches, particularly in cases where ROIs are sparse or inconsistent across images. Overall, this proposed method provides a new way to leverage the strengths of prior knowledge and self-supervision techniques, enabling efficient and effective network training from large amounts of unlabeled data."

      "generation": "Title: Color image segmentation using adaptive particle swarm optimization and fuzzy c-means\nAbstract:\r\nImage segmentation is a fundamental operation in computer vision that allows for object recognition, tracking, and analysis. One of the most common techniques used for color image segmentation is fuzzy c-means clustering. However, traditional implementation of fuzzy c-means has limitations such as sensitivity to initialization and local minimums, which hinder its performance particularly on complex images. This study proposes an improved algorithm by incorporating particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to iteratively adjust parameters during fuky c-means segmentation. Furthermore, we utilised grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) to provide spatial dependencies between pixels in the image to improve the robustness of our method. We evaluate and compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art techniques such as k-nearest neighbour cluster analysis and histogram equalization. Experimentally, our approach outperforms other methods and achieves highly accurate results on various benchmark datasets.\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\nAdaptive particle swarm optimization, fuzzy c-means, image segmentation, colour image processing, grey level co-occurrence matrix"

Medical image segmentation is one such task where the availability of annotated images limits advances in computer vision techniques. In this context, semi-supervised approaches can utilize a combination of both labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations, allowing for more efficient usage of available resources. In this study, we propose a novel method that extends the effectiveness of these existing approaches by introducing uncertainty measures in our model training process to capture variations across input samples and improve generalization accuracy. Our method improves performances on several benchmark datasets while reducing the number of labelling requirements by incorporating prior knowledge or beliefs about the underlying distributions using Bayesian frameworks. The utilization of semantic maps from unlabeled images allows our approach to leverage information from raw images without any labeled pixels, resulting in better results compared to traditional supervised methods. Overall, this work highlights the utility of leveraging uncertainties within the semi-supervision paradigm as an additional strategy to improve the robustness of deep learning pipelines in medical image analysis applications."

While many methods exist to estimate the probability of image segments, accurate computation of valid p-values has proven elusive due to the difficulty of assessing uncertainty across all possible segment masks. This work introduces selective inference, an extension of Bayesian model selection to address this challenge. We propose using prior knowledge about the distribution over models to efficiently sample from the posterior distribution of segment labels and corresponding p-values. Our approach can handle complex backgrounds and rare objects, while avoiding the use of costly sampling schemes such as MCMC or Monte Carlo Tree Search. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state of the art performance on the UCI Landsat dataset and competitive results on other standard benchmarks like MIT Adairsville, PASCAL VOC 2008 and COCO-Matting. Additionally, we offer online implementation codes that are available to facilitate further research in Image Segmentation using Selective Inference."

The accuracy of segmentation is highly dependent on the quality of the segmentation algorithm used. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize the dice score and Jaccard index for medical image segmentation. We first introduce the concept of the dice score and Jaccard index, which are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of segmentation algorithms. We then propose a theoretical framework for optimizing these metrics, which involves minimizing the difference between the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments on various medical image datasets, and show that our method can significantly improve the accuracy of segmentation algorithms.

The accuracy of the segmented images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of patients. In this study, we explore the factors that affect the performance of two commonly used metrics, the dice score, and Jaccard index. We propose a new algorithm to optimize these scores based on the statistical properties of the ground truth labels and segmented images. Our theoretical model shows that the optimal thresholding method varies between the dice score and Jaccard index depending on the distribution of label values. In practice, we evaluate our method using three publicly available datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate significantly improved segmentation accuracy when using our proposed approach. Our findings can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and improve patient outcomes."

The proposed method incorporates CNNs with different outputs into the same architecture to allow for concurrent processing of these separate classes while maintaining interpretability and flexibility.\n\nThe effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments involving image segmentation using five color labels on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Results show improved performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods that use binary or ternary label images.

In this paper, we introduce Pick-and-Learn, an approach that uses limited label sets to automatically evaluate the quality of noisy labeled data during training. Our novel system iteratively selects a subset of ground truth examples from each label class and assigns them to different subsets of the model's outputs. We then measure the correlation between these examples on the one hand and their assigned output on the other using a similarity metric. This process allows us to identify areas where the model is likely to have low confidence due to noise or ambiguity in the labels themselves.

Traditional methods rely on synthesizing single-frame images from scratch, which can be difficult and computationally expensive. However, recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers to generate high-quality vehicle images using conditional generative models (cGANs).\nOne approach to this problem is called \"vehicle image generation going well with the surroundings.\" This method uses cGANs to generate images of vehicles in various environmental conditions, such as day or night, rainy or sunny weather, and varying levels of visibility. It takes into account not only the appearance of the vehicle itself but also its surrounding environment, allowing for more realistic and diverse results.\nTo achieve this, cGANs are trained on large datasets of real-world images, including both vehicle images and their corresponding environmental contexts. The generator then learns to incorporate this information during training, resulting in highly accurate and visually appealing generated images that match their respective real-world counterparts.\nOverall, \"vehicle image generation going well with the surroundings\" offers promising new avenues for research in computer vision and has applications in areas such as autonomous driving, virtual reality, and visual effects."

In this study, we explore the potential of CUSUM filter to improve brain segmen- tation accuracy in diffusion tensor sequence (DTS) perfused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head scans, particularly among subjects with abnormal brain anatomy.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nIn this study, we first preprocessed the MR images and then applied a patch extraction algorithm to extract patches from each voxel. We then trained the CUSUM filter using a patch classification approach. The performance of CUSUM was compared with other popular methods such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and K-Means on a dataset consisting of 135 healthy controls and patients affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or mild cognitive impairment. Our study aimed to examine whether CUSUM outperforms these traditional models in terms of segmentation accuracy.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nOur results showed that CUSUM filter achieved competitive accuracy across all three classes including normal brains, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and mild cognitive impairment, while also being effective at handling brain anomalies present in the MR scans. Additionally, we found an association between CUSUM filter performance and age in patients with Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impariment which makes it useful tool for clinical evaluation. \r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nOverall, our findings demonstrate that CUSUM filter can overcome some limitations in existing brain segme- ntation techniques that are typically seen in cases of complex and heterogeneous data. Therefore, our findings suggest that the CUSUM model could be a valuable addition to the machine learning arsenal in neurological research and disease diagnosis for DTS perfused MRI."

Traditional approaches to neuron segmentation have been limited by their dependence on manual intervention or pixel-based methods, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advances in deep learning technology allow the automated processing of large EM images through convolutional neural networks, offering an efficient solution for neuron segmentation. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilizes metric graphs as input data for deep convolutional learning to automate the process of neuron segmentation. \nMethodology:\nIn total, 3812 neurons were manually labeled in six different neuronal types from multiple brains across various staining protocols. A novel dataset containing labeled pixels, associated with information about connected components and distances between these components, was created using CNTK (Cerebellar Nuclei Tracking and Quantification Kit), an open-source software package specifically designed for quantifying cellular morphologies. Metrics derived from this dataset include surface area, volume, eccentricity, roundness, axis ratio, branch order and length, spanning diagonal, mean curvature and Euler angle. These metrics were then used to learn topological and structural graph representations of a single sample, followed by transferring learned models onto new samples. Our method achieves highly accurate results comparable to those generated by human expert labelers while being significantly faster than traditional manual labeling techniques.\nConclusion:\nThe proposed learning procedure leverages deep learning algorithms to extract high-level semantics from both geometric shapes and connectivity relationships among neurites, providing insight into complex neuromorphological structures within EM images. The method described has potential applications beyond neuroscience, including other fields such as plant development and virus characterization, where identifying and tracking objects with distinct characteristics can greatly aid understanding biochemical or biological processes."

      "generation": "In this study, we present a novel method for fast computation of matrix-vector products involving the graph Laplacian of fully connected networks. The proposed approach employs both the Nonzero Frequency Fourier Transform (NFFT) and the Iterative Refinement with the Krylov Subspace Methods (\\textit{IRKSM}).\r\n\r\nFirstly, NFFT is used to approximate the graph Laplacian in its eigenspace representation, reducing the size of the original sparse matrix by orders of magnitude. This enables us to perform vector multiplications efficiently on the compressed matrix using only arithmetic operations on smaller matrices instead of dense computations on the large graph representations.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, IRKSM is applied to improve the accuracy of the matrix-vector product obtained from NFFT approximation. IRKSM uses the iterated refinements based on subspaces generated by matrix powers to capture higher order information about the underlying structure of the network. By incorporating both techniques into a unified framework, our method achieves significant reductions in time complexity compared to other state-of-the-art techniques without compromising accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through several examples and simulations on various scales and show that it can outperform existing methods in terms of performance and computational efficiency."

It then applies a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to the transformed image resulting in better segmented cloud regions. To evaluate our performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Jaccard index were utilized.\n\nIn this work we report the improvements of approximately +4% cloud coverage classification and -26% uncertainty compared respectively to baseline and ground truth data.

Firstly, we propose a novel dataset for radiology imaging consisting of 50 volumes with segmented abnormalities using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Then, two convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models were implemented; SqueezeNet v1.2 and U-Net4+. Both models showed promising results, but U-Net4+ outperformed SqueezeNet at segmentation and prediction tasks, achieving F1 scores of 81% and 79%, respectively. Next, we used an attention mechanism to improve CNN interpretability leading us to develop the A-U-Net4+; it performed better than U-Net in segmentation accuracy and achieved impressive FNC-L scores on unseen data. Finally, the proposed real-time system predicted the percentage difference between manual annotation and automated segment results based on four factors: input class, image size, output resolution, and batch size. Overall, these findings demonstrate that real-time assessment of segment quality can aid clinicians and radiologists when making decisions about patient medical diagnoses and care plans."

      "generation": "Introduction:\nMedical image segmentation is a crucial task in many medical applications, including tumor detection, diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. In recent years, deep learning techniques have significantly improved the performance of traditional segmentation methods by automatically extracting features from raw images. However, these methods often require large amounts of training data and computational resources, which can be challenging to obtain in some cases. Moreover, they may not always provide interpretable results or allow for interactive segmentation, which is important in certain clinical settings. Therefore, there is a need for alternative approaches that balance accuracy with efficiency and flexibility.\nPoint-based interaction (PBI):\nIn this work, we propose an interactive medical image segmentation method based on point-based interaction and sequential patch learning. The proposed approach allows users to interactively modify segmentations by adding, removing, and merging individual points in the input image, as well as adjusting the parameters of the model dynamically at each iteration. Specifically, the algorithm uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms to learn the context of pixel values in the image, and then applies a patch-match optimization technique to minimize the difference between the predicted and ground truth labels. Furthermore, we incorporate several novel algorithms aimed at facilitating PBI, such as a fuzzy clustering scheme for efficient local search and hierarchical sampling for global exploration. \nExperimental results:\nWe validated our method using four public and three private datasets that cover various types of pathologies. Qualitative analysis showed that our approach outperforms both classical segmentation methods and other state-of-the-art deep models. Quantitative metrics, such as Dice coefficients and Jaccard indices, demonstrated substantial improvement over previous works. Moreover, the number of iterations required by our method to achieve satisfactory results was significantly lower than that of competitive alternatives. We also conducted user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of PBI, and found that our method enables fast and accurate segmentation while providing high reproducibility and robustness against noise and ambiguity in the images.\nConclusion:\nIn summary, we presented an innovative approach to interactive medical image segmentation that combines PBI and patch learning. Our method provides superior performance, interactive capability,"

This technique involves dividing an image into small regions based on homogeneity criteria in color or texture. However, traditional image segmentation methods fall short when dealing with complex images that have varying shapes, sizes, and textures.\n\nTo address this challenge, a novel adaptive strategy is introduced for superpixel-based region growing (SPRGR) image segmentation. As compared to typical RG techniques, SPRGR method enhances image accuracy by incorporating prior knowledge or heuristics about substructural features within candidate pixels, resulting in significant improvements in processing efficiency and results. In addition, the proposed approach considers various factors including geometric shape, intensity, texture, context, connectivity information and statistical likelihood, which all allow for better discrimination between relevant regions in the image.\n\nThe proposed algorithm operates through three stages: selection, expansion, and splitting. First, promising initial seeds are identified via the use of various superpixels from the input image. Next, neighboring regions are expanded using an iterative process until they satisfy specific segmentation criteria. Finally, unwanted segments or incorrectly allocated subregions are removed and replaced through dynamic recursive splitting processes.\n\nExperiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm in achieving highly accurate results with minimal human intervention across diverse sets of test data. Additionally, its performance is comparable to others state-of-the-art deep learning-driven approaches, but it requires significantly less computation power and time, making it much more accessible on resource constraint platforms. Hence, the proposed adaptive mechanism represents a valuable contribution towards improving robustness of image segmentation algorithms while maintaining computational feasibility."

Various preprocessing methods, including normalization, registration, and feature extraction are often applied to enhance the performance of these algorithms. Additionally, multiple validation strategies such as cross-validation and leave one out validation have been employed to assess the generalizability of the models.\nThis survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computer-assisted knee joint MRIsegmentation, including the approaches, evaluation metrics, and challenges associated with each technique. It also highlights some promising future directions, such as transfer learning and multi-modality integration, which have shown promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of MRI segmentations.

      "generation": "Semantic segmentation is a popular computer vision task that aims to assign each pixel in an image to its corresponding class label. A significant challenge in this task lies in its complexity, which requires capturing both high spatial resolution and semantic information. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have emerged as effective solutions to address these challenges by leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite their effectiveness, there are limitations to existing CNN-based approaches, such as unbalanced class distribution and vanishing gradients. This study addresses those limitations by proposing a novel approach called 'highly fused convolutional network with multiple soft cost functions' to improve semantic segmentation performance. Specifically, our method utilizes a highly fused CNN architecture consisting of multiple blocks that utilize skip connections between layers at different scales, making it robust against overfitting. Moreover, we introduce multiple soft cost functions that encourage the model to attend not only to the local context but also to the global context during training, improving its ability to capture long-range dependencies between pixels.

Our proposed method first performs traditional semantic segmentation using a pretrained CNN model, and then applies boundary enhancement and refinement processes based on edge information extracted from additional fine-tuned models that focus solely on detecting edges rather than semantics. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage both high level semantics learned by the initial network and low-level edge information captured by specialized models to produce more accurate segmentations.\nOur experiments on three common benchmark datasets show significant improvements in performance and accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed technique for enhancing semantic image segmentation through the incorporation of edge detection."

This technique involves combining multiple atlases to improve the accuracy of segmentation results. However, most existing methods only consider two dimensions - X and Y axes. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing 4D multi-atlas label fusion using longitudinal images, which takes into account both spatial and temporal correlations among different timepoints.\n\nMethodology:\nWe propose a novel approach that utilizes four-dimensional (3D+1) imaging data sets with different acquisition times, i.e., longitudinal brain imaging data. The proposed algorithm first extracts features from each timepoint using separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Then, we merge these feature maps using weighted averaging, where the weights are learned through Bayesian optimization to optimize the prediction task. Finally, we perform cross-modal registration between the fused map and input data set to produce refined labels.\n\nResults:\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over other state-of-the-art techniques including both 2D and 3D label fusion techniques. Our proposed approach outperforms current methods in terms of accuracy and generalization capability on several challenging datasets such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Furthermore, it achieves better performance than traditional multimodal label fusion approaches using non-invasive EEG modality. We also provide evidence that incorporating temporal information improves the performance of the fusion process, particularly in cases with coarse anatomical changes or limited temporal resolution.\n\nConclusion:\nIn summary, the proposed 4D multi-atlas label fusion using longitudinal images shows promise in improving the accuracy of medical image segmentation tasks. By including temporal dimension, our method performs well across various conditions with spatiotemporally related structures providing more robust predictions in clinical practice."

      "generation": "The field of medical image segmentation has seen significant advancements over recent years, driven by breakthroughs in deep learning techniques. However, there remain several challenges to overcome before these methods can be widely adopted in clinical practice. One such challenge is dealing with variability in size and shape between different types of images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for iteratively normalizing inputs during training of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for medical image segmentation tasks. In our method, we use an adaptive batchnorm, which modulates normalization parameters during each iteration based on input data statistics, enabling the model to converge faster and achieve better generalization capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate our proposed technique on three publicly available benchmarks: the Ischemia-Challenge, the CT-Lung dataset, and the MIMIC IV Challenge. We demonstrate that the adaptive batchnorm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides robust improvements across all datasets tested, achieving gains by up to 5% in terms of precision/recall metrics.\r\n\r\nOur work highlights the importance of normalizing inputs during training of CNN models for medical image segmentation tasks. By leveraging statistical information within batches during training, Our framework shows that it's possible to overcome variations between image types while improving model performance.\r\n\r\nOverall, our research provides valuable insights into how to improve existing approaches towards more reliable, high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation."

Graphs allow representing image data in a powerful way, making it possible to analyze the relationships between pixels, thus enabling us to obtain more comprehensive information about images. Entropy represents how spread out information is within an object or system, playing an important role in various applications like classification and compression. In this work, we show how graph-based entropy can enhance the performance of segmentation algorithms by capturing complex patterns in the images, which are difficult to model using other approaches. We first construct graphs that preserve all pixel dependencies from the original image, then apply our graph-based methods to segment the image.

To test this hypothesis, we first collected a large dataset of images containing multispectral information spanning from the visible to NIR wavelengths. We then developed an advanced neural network architecture capable of utilizing all channels, including the NIR range, simultaneously during training. The results show that the inclusion of NIR information resulted in significant improvements in semantic segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms trained on visible-light only data. Specifically, we found that adding the NIR channel led to increased object detection, enhanced edge preservations, and improved accuracy for certain types of objects such as leaves and fruits.

Then, the membership value of each data point is updated based on how well it deviates from this center within its cluster boundaries, where neighboring clusters share common boundary points by definition. By iteratively applying this rule until convergence or reaching a maximum number of iterations, the VM method reduces computational complexity while preserving accurate results compared to other known techniques such as DBSCAN and OPTICS. We verify our model through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying complex clusters and determining their similarities more accurately than traditional methods.

      "generation": "Introduction:\nThe optimization of energy consumption in mobile devices has recently gained recognition as an important research area. One of the main concerns is to provide a mechanism for enforcing statistics on mobile devices while minimizing energy usage. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that reduces unnecessary data transmissions between multiple systems by leveraging statistical properties and optimized communication techniques to achieve optimal performance. We evaluate our approach using a simulation-based environment that provides insights into its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our results show significant reduce in energy consumption without compromising system reliability. Overall, this work presents a novel methodology for enabling efficient energy minimization for enforcing statistics in mobile devices.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nWe propose an approach known as 'enforcement through feedback'. This technique involves collecting statistical samples from different systems involved in the network, allowing us to detect anomalies and potential threats. Whenever such deviations occur, we take appropriate actions to correct them without causing any disruption in the entire system. The approach uses Bayesian updating algorithm which utilizes prior probability distributions to calculate the posterior probabilities for each observed event. \r\n\r\nTo further minimize energy usage, we use an adaptive sampling strategy that adjusts sampling rates and thresholds based on changing network parameters. Additionally, we leverage multi-objective optimisation methods like Pareto Optimisation and Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) that jointly optimize several metrics simultaneously. \r\n\r\nEvaluation and Results:\r\nOur proposed method was evaluated using a virtual environment that includes five mobile devices connected to a central server via wireless networks with varying capacity. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms the existing baseline methods and achieves optimum energy efficiency whilst maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, the system can recover from outliers, failures or security breaches without requiring human intervention. By incorporating machine learning algorithms and optimising sample collection strategies, we have developed a highly effective and efficient method for enforcing statistics on mobile devices."

In addition, image inpaining is a technique used to fill missing pixels in damaged images. Both techniques have found applications in various fields such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. However, existing methods often struggle with complex curvature patterns, leading to suboptimal results.\n\nBackground:\nThe traditional approach to region-based image segmentation relies on thresholding the gradient magnitude or a combination of features such as texture, intensity, and edge maps. These methods are successful in simple scenes but fail in cases with complicated geometry or occlusions. Curvature measures provide a way to quantify the smoothness or complexity of edges in an image. By incorporating curvature into image segmentation schemes we can improve their robustness to noise and variations in lighting conditions. \n\nMethodology:\nThis research presents a novel method for region-based image segmentation and inpainting that utilizes a linear programming formulation. We incorporate curvature penalties and regularization terms into our objective function, allowing us to capture smooth local geometric structures. We show how to effectively segment and inpaint images using this framework through numerical simulations. \n\nResults:\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme by measuring its performance on real-world and synthetic datasets. Our results indicate significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models, particularly when dealing with curved boundaries.\n\nConclusion:\nOur work shows that incorporating curvature information into image segmentation and inpainting tasks significantly improves their accuracy and robustness.

We consider a class of parabolic systems with measurable coefficients and study the existence and uniqueness of solutions in $L^2$. We also study the regularity of solutions and the existence of a priori estimates. Our results extend previous results on the $L^2$ well-posedness of parabolic systems with constant coefficients to the case of measurable coefficients. Our proofs use a combination of techniques from measure theory, functional analysis, and stochastic analysis."

      "generation": "The abstract for this research paper is as follows: \r\n\r\nWe prove the $L^2$ well-posedness of a class of boundary value problems for time-dependent partial differential equations with spatially varying, $L^\\infty$ or Lebesgue integrable coefficients. These results extend previously known estimates to include more general classes of coefficient functions. We also establish new criteria for optimal rates of convergence of weak solutions in $L^p$. Our work provides an important tool for numerical analysis and offers insights into regularity phenomena arising from stochastic processes with bounded variance and non-positive covariance."
